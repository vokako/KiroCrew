"""Repo-root pytest configuration: the host-mutation floor.

``test/conftest.py`` holds the bulk of the suite's isolation, but it only applies
to ``test/``. ``[tool:pytest] testpaths`` also collects ``transfer`` and
``src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins`` (~108 test modules that ship inside the package,
next to the code they cover), and those get no ``test/conftest.py`` fixtures at
all -- only this file, plus that app's own ``tests/conftest.py`` where one exists.
Anything that must hold for EVERY test therefore has to live here, at the
rootdir, which is the one conftest pytest applies to every testpath.

Only the HOST-MUTATION FLOOR belongs in this file: the guards that must hold for a
test collected from any testpath, because what they protect is the
developer's machine rather than the correctness of one suite. Everything that is
merely suite-specific isolation stays in ``test/conftest.py``.

The floor has eight parts, and each one exists because the "remember to isolate
this" contract failed at least once:

* **Services.** ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` is redirected and the stdlib spawn funnels
  refuse a ``systemctl``/``launchctl`` invocation carrying a mutating verb, so no
  test can reconfigure or restart the operator's real gateway (issue #1722).
* **The data home.** ``KIROCREW_HOME`` is pinned per test, and the ``~/.kiro``
  paths that production binds at IMPORT time (which the env var cannot reach) are
  pinned with it. Without this, the ~108 test modules that ship inside the package
  under ``src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins/*/tests/`` -- which see this conftest and no
  other -- write the operator's live ``~/.kiro/crew`` the moment they touch
  ``config_dir()``. ``KIROCREW_WORKSPACE`` is pinned alongside it for the same
  reason: ``workspace_root()`` is a SEPARATE default from ``config_dir()`` (it
  falls back to ``~/workplace/kirocrew-workspace``, not under the data home at
  all), so pinning only ``KIROCREW_HOME`` leaves it resolving to the operator's
  real ``~/workplace`` the moment a test reaches an agent working directory.
* **Credential environment.** Recognised fixed credentials and validated
  ``JIRA_TOKEN_<HEX>`` keys are restored after every test, so a fabricated
  ``.env`` cannot silently override the next test's credentials in the same
  worker.
* **The inherited shell environment.** The entries ``name_grant`` refuses as
  inherited preloads are removed for each test's duration and restored
  afterwards: the ``_ENV_PRELOAD_VARS`` names (``BASH_ENV``, ``ENV``, ...) and
  exported bash functions (``BASH_FUNC_*`` keys, or the legacy bare-name
  spelling whose value starts with ``() {``). RHEL-family hosts export ``which``
  as a function from ``/etc/profile.d/which2.sh``, and that refusal is checked
  before every narrower code, so 79 of 163 name-grant tests observed the wrong
  refusal on those hosts while Ubuntu CI stayed green (issue #8395).
* **The agent-spec home.** ``kiro_agents_dir()`` is a LAZY resolver, so neither of
  the two above reaches it, and a test that reaches the spec write path rewrites
  the machine-wide ``<kiro home>/agents/kirocrew.json`` -- the file that decides
  which MCP servers the operator's real agent has (issue #4912). The per-module
  override seams are pinned instead of ``KIRO_HOME``, which cannot be pinned
  without overriding ~35 tests' own ``Path.home()`` isolation.
* **The system temp directory.** ``tempfile``'s base is redirected to a per-run
  directory for the whole process, so a bare ``mkdtemp()`` whose cleanup is missing
  or skipped leaves its directory somewhere this run owns and removes, instead of
  accumulating in the shared temp root forever. What was left behind is REPORTED
  first, so the leak is a red rather than silent inode consumption. On macOS the
  base is additionally moved to ``/tmp`` -- the prefix Linux and CI already use --
  because the launchd per-user temp dir is long enough to break an AF_UNIX bind and
  random enough to read as a credential. See :data:`_SHORT_TMP_BASE`.
* **The sandbox mount-source sweep.** The periodic janitor's candidate roots
  (the operator's real ``/run/user/$UID`` and ``/dev/shm``) and its /proc pin
  scan are both pinned to inert stand-ins -- the roots to an empty directory,
  the scan to fail-closed -- so no test deletes real orphaned bind-mount
  sources from the developer's machine or depends on host process state.
* **The repository checkout.** The run fails when it ends with residue anywhere in
  the checkout, which is how a subprocess spawned without ``cwd=`` announces
  itself.

One consequence of living at the rootdir: the module name ``conftest`` is now
resolvable from the repository root as well as from ``test/``, and 11 test modules
import helpers by bare name (``from conftest import requires_git``). Under pytest's
default ``prepend`` import mode each test module's own directory goes on
``sys.path`` first, so those imports still bind to ``test/conftest.py`` -- but the
name IS shadowed, so switching to ``--import-mode=importlib`` would need those
imports made explicit first. The visible effect today is that isort now classifies
``conftest`` as first-party (a root-level module is inside its default
``src_paths``), which is why this change also reorders that import in the modules
that use it.

Why this floor exists (issue #1722): a test asserting that a staged cutover can
be *cancelled* rewrote the operator's real ``kirocrew-gateway.service`` drop-in
to point at its own pytest temp dir. pytest deleted the temp dir at the end of
the run; the drop-in survived, so systemd looped on ``203/EXEC`` — 548 failed
starts over 25 minutes. The test never intended to touch the host: it called the
real ``_make_live()`` because that function was the subject under test, and two
of that function's seams (the drop-in path and the subprocess layer) were left
for each test to remember to stub.

The fixtures below remove that "remember to" from the contract. None of them
changes the behaviour of a test that already isolates itself correctly: every one
sets a value a test can still override, and a test that sets its own
``KIROCREW_HOME`` or its own temp dir keeps winning.

Imports at MODULE level are stdlib + pytest only, on purpose: a rootdir conftest is
imported before every collection, so pulling ``kiro_crew`` in here would make the
whole suite depend on import-time side effects of the package under test. The
fixtures that do need ``kiro_crew`` import it in their own body, which runs at test
setup -- by which point the test module has already imported the package anyway --
and tolerate an ImportError so a partial checkout cannot break collection.

# resolved against the CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY, i.e. the repo root, for every test
# collected from ANY testpath -- including the ~108 modules under

# That writes an untracked directory into the checkout on every run (git status shows it
# under "Ignored files" since ``.gitignore`` covers it, but it still needs a place to live
# that is not the source tree).
#
# Profiles are process-global, so whichever profile is active when a ``@given`` test runs
# applies regardless of which testpath collected it. Registering a "default" profile here
# at module level would not stick: ``test/conftest.py`` re-registers "default" by name
# right after this module loads (pytest imports the rootdir conftest first, then
# ``test/conftest.py`` -- see ``pytest_load_initial_conftests``), and ``register_profile``
# without ``parent=`` builds a fresh settings object from scratch, silently resetting
# ``database`` back to the on-disk default. Doing the redirect from ``pytest_configure``
# instead runs after both conftests' module-level code, so it lands last: ``parent=`` keeps
# whatever ``max_examples``/``deadline``/health-check suppression ``test/conftest.py`` set,

    it inherits the tmp paths anyway.

    ``start_new_session``, so it leads no tree of its own). That decision is a

    SYNTHETIC pid (4242 is the shared convention) with the tree kill mocked. The

    when some genuine process happens to own it AND sits in the pytest run's own
    process group, the skip fires, no tree kill is recorded, and the assertion
    fails. Under xdist the runner spawns plenty of low-pid children in exactly
    that group, which is why this flaked in batches -- four tests across three
    files in one run -- and passed on re-run.

    The pin is the child-leads-its-own-group answer, i.e. tree kill attempted,

    ``KiroCrewConfig.load_credentials()`` deliberately propagates every credential
    it reads into ``os.environ`` with ``setdefault``, so a spawned child (sandboxed
    agent, MCP server, cron subprocess) inherits it through ``Popen``'s default
    ``env=os.environ.copy()``. Any test that points ``env_path()`` at a fabricated

    The usual guard does not catch this, which is what makes it worth a floor:

    nothing to undo, so a value written during the test is restored to nothing.

    And the residue is not inert -- ``load_credentials`` lets ``os.environ`` WIN
    over the file it just read, so the next test pointing at a different ``.env``
    is answered with the previous test's token. Observed between
    ``test_handlers_messaging_coverage.py`` and ``test_review_fixes.py``: a Slack

    """Hide the entries ``name_grant`` refuses as inherited preloads, then restore them.

    RHEL-family distributions (Amazon Linux 2023, RHEL, CentOS Stream, Fedora) ship
    ``/etc/profile.d/which2.sh``, which exports ``which`` as a shell function -- so
    ``BASH_FUNC_which%%`` sits in ``os.environ`` of any login shell before pytest even
    starts. ``name_grant._inherited_preload()`` fires its AMBIGUOUS_ENV refusal on
    exactly that shape, and that refusal is checked before every narrower code, so on
    such a host 79 of the 163 tests in ``test/test_name_grant.py`` observed
    ``inherited_env_can_redefine_programs`` instead of the code they assert, while
    Ubuntu CI (no ``which2.sh``) stayed green (issue #8395). The detector's OTHER half
    is host state just as easily: a login profile exporting ``BASH_ENV``, or a
    container image setting ``ENV``, reproduces the same failure shape with no
    ``which2.sh`` anywhere. The PRODUCT behaviour is correct -- an inherited preload
    genuinely can redefine a program the agent runs -- the gap was that this floor
    pins the data home, the credential env and the temp base, but not the environment
    the run inherited.

    The predicate is IMPORTED from ``name_grant`` rather than restated, so the scrub
    and the detector cannot drift apart, and it mirrors BOTH halves the detector
    checks: the ``_ENV_PRELOAD_VARS`` names (matched truthy, exactly as the detector's
    ``os.environ.get(var)`` reads them -- an empty value triggers no refusal and is
    left alone), and the exported-function pair (the ``BASH_FUNC_`` key prefix, plus
    the legacy bare-name spelling whose value starts with ``() {``). It is also
    deliberately no WIDER than that predicate: this is not a general "no exported
    functions" floor -- how wide the detector should be is ``name_grant``'s design
    question, and the scrub merely mirrors its answer. The import is deliberately
    UNGUARDED, like ``_no_credential_env_residue``'s: an ImportError escape hatch
    would disarm the scrub silently on a broken checkout and hand back the exact
    79-failure pattern this fixture exists to remove, as a wall of wrong refusal
    codes instead of one clear error.

    The removals are recorded on the test's shared ``monkeypatch`` instance rather
    than hand-rolled, and that is load-bearing, not convenience. Same-scope autouse
    fixtures are ordered so that OTHER monkeypatch users run first (alphabetically in
    practice), so a hand-rolled save/restore here tears down BEFORE monkeypatch's
    undo -- and for a test that ``monkeypatch.setenv``-overrides the SAME key the
    host inherited (recorded "was absent", because this scrub had removed it), the
    undo then deletes the inherited value the hand-rolled restore had just put back,
    leaking the removal out of the test. On one shared undo stack the nesting is
    correct BY CONSTRUCTION: the test's later record is undone first (its delete
    tolerates the key already being gone), then this fixture's ``delenv`` record
    restores the inherited value. ``test_name_grant.py::TestInheritedHostEnvironment``
    pins exactly that same-key case, and
    ``test_host_isolation_floor.py::TestInheritedShellEnvironmentIsScrubbed`` drives
    one real cycle of this fixture directly.

    The deliberate AMBIGUOUS_ENV tests lose nothing: they construct their entries
    inside the test body, after the scrub. The teardown sweep below is the
    ``_no_credential_env_residue`` half of the contract: a matching entry still
    present at teardown is either a raw ``os.environ`` write (no undo record --
    swept here, stays gone) or a monkeypatch-managed one (its undo re-deletes
    tolerantly or restores what it recorded), so nothing this fixture scrubbed and
    nothing a test leaked survives past the test on this worker.

    Redirecting ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` above stops a test from *writing* a real
    unit file, but not from *running* ``systemctl --user daemon-reload`` or
    ``systemctl --user restart kirocrew-gateway.service``. Those restart the
    developer's live gateway even when the drop-in they read is pristine, so the
    second half of the floor has to be an execution guard.

    Patched at the deepest stdlib funnels rather than at the names call sites
    happen to use, so the guard cannot be bypassed by import style:

    * ``subprocess.Popen.__init__`` — every sync spawn funnels here, including
      ``run``, ``check_call`` and ``check_output``, and including a module that
      did ``from subprocess import run`` (that ``run`` still resolves ``Popen``
      through its own module globals).
    * ``BaseEventLoop.subprocess_exec`` / ``subprocess_shell`` — every
      ``asyncio.create_subprocess_*`` funnels here, so patching these also covers
      ``from asyncio import create_subprocess_exec``.
    * ``os.execve`` — ``live_target.maybe_reexec()`` execs into another checkout,
      which would REPLACE the pytest process with a real gateway. Guarded
      unconditionally: no argv inspection makes that sane in a test.

      ``os.execv`` is deliberately NOT guarded. The two exec paths in this
      codebase use different funnels, and the difference is load-bearing:
      ``maybe_reexec`` needs ``execve`` because it hands the gateway a modified
      environment across the exec, while ``spawn/exec_shim`` uses ``execv``
      precisely because it passes its inherited environment through untouched
      ("execv, not execve: the environment this process was given IS the
      environment the caller built"). The shim's exec also happens in a CHILD
      process (it is spawned as ``python -c <shim source>``), so trapping
      ``execv`` here protects nothing and only breaks the shim's in-process unit
      tests of its own 127-on-exec-failure contract.
      ``test_host_service_guard.py`` ratchets the assumption that
      ``live_target`` still execs through ``execve``.

    The mechanism follows ``test/test_update_git_guard.py``, which already
    monkeypatches ``create_subprocess_exec`` to raise on an unwanted spawn. The
    difference is scope: this one is autouse, so it holds for tests nobody
    thought to write a guard for.

    Everything else is delegated to the real implementation untouched — which
    matters more than it sounds, because ``sandbox`` wraps nearly every spawn in
    this codebase in ``systemd-run --scope`` for cgroup limits. A guard keyed on
    binaries rather than verbs refused ``git config``.

    Every warning this suite emits is retained for the whole session, and one kind of
    warning brings a whole test's object graph with it.

    The chain: ``_pytest/warnings.py`` records each warning with
    ``pytest_warning_recorded.call_historic(...)``, and pluggy appends those kwargs to
    ``_HookCaller._call_history`` -- a list it never clears, because a historic hook
    exists precisely to be replayed to plugins registered later. So the
    ``warnings.WarningMessage`` survives to the end of the run. Ordinarily that is a
    few hundred bytes. But ``WarningMessage.source`` is the OBJECT the warning is
    about, and for ``RuntimeWarning: coroutine '...' was never awaited`` that object is
    the coroutine: it holds its frame, its frame holds every local, and those locals
    hold whatever the test built. One un-awaited coroutine therefore pins an entire
    test's graph for the session, in every worker.

    ``trylast`` is what makes this free of diagnostic loss, and it is not a
    preference. ``TerminalReporter.pytest_warning_recorded`` renders the warning to a
    plain string IMMEDIATELY -- including ``tracemalloc_message(source)``, the
    "Object allocated at:" traceback when tracemalloc is tracing and the "Enable
    tracemalloc" hint when it is not -- and stores that string. Running last means the
    text is already built before the reference goes, so nothing a reader would have
    seen is lost. Clearing it ``tryfirst`` WOULD lose that suffix, which is why the
    ordering is pinned by a test.

    Kept as a BACKSTOP rather than for its average saving, and the distinction is
    measured. Where un-awaited coroutines cluster it is large: ``test_dashboard_chat.py``
    emits 60 of them across 590 tests, and clearing ``source`` takes that file from 284
    to 219 MiB. On a mixed slice it is worth nothing at all -- an AsyncMock-dense

    """Move the collected item tree out of the garbage collector's reach.

    Collecting every testpath leaves roughly three million objects alive, and they
    are alive for the rest of the run by design -- the item tree, its fixture closures,
    the rewritten assertion code. The garbage collector does not know that, so every
    full pass walks all of them looking for cycles it will never find. Worse, on the
    interpreters this suite supports the full collection is scheduled from a measure of
    how much long-lived material exists, so that static population also DELAYS
    collection: a test's own cyclic garbage waits longer before anything reclaims it.
    (The exact scheduling differs across 3.10-3.13 -- 3.13 replaced the generational
    threshold with an incremental collector -- but the static set is unscanned either
    way, which is the part this depends on.)

    ``gc.freeze()`` moves everything currently tracked into a permanent generation that
    is never scanned. Measured over 3,798 test executions: full passes went 1 -> 3 and
    the objects they reclaimed went 61,604 -> 423,380, a 6.9x improvement in how much
    cyclic garbage is actually collected during a run.

    The end-RSS effect is small on its own (-3.5 MiB) because freed memory stays in the
    allocator's arena rather than returning to the OS. What it buys is that the garbage
    is reclaimed at all, which is why it is worth keeping despite the modest number.

    Placed at collection finish, not at configure: before collection there is nothing
    worth freezing, and after the first test the population is no longer purely static.
    Freezing is safe here for the same reason it helps -- these objects were going to
    live for the whole session anyway. Verified rather than assumed: live tracked objects
    at session end are slightly FEWER with the freeze than without (3,221,373 vs
    3,235,522), uncollectable stays 0, and the frozen count itself falls during the run,
    so refcount reclamation still works inside the permanent generation. Only cyclic
    garbage created BEFORE the freeze could leak, and collection creates none.

    It also helps the sandbox's ``fork``-based probes rather than hurting them: this is
    the documented pre-fork optimization, and the 16 sandbox suites pass identically
    with and without it.

    Records the delta rather than leaving the effect to be inferred from
    ``gc.get_freeze_count()``: the interpreter already has a few hundred objects frozen
    before this runs, so a bare "is anything frozen" assertion passes with this hook
    deleted.

    directory it pointed at outlived the run. It is not survivable now: with

    that test's own teardown, so a test that chdirs into ``tmp_path`` and does not come
    back leaves the worker sitting in a DELETED directory -- and then ``Path.cwd()`` raises
    ``FileNotFoundError`` in every later test that reaches it, including deep inside
    production code (``taskrunner.TaskRunner.__init__`` does ``work_dir or Path.cwd()``).

    Measured instance and its numbers:

    **A ``tryfirst`` teardown hook rather than an autouse fixture, and the difference is
    load-bearing on Windows.** A fixture here would be an OUTER one (the rootdir conftest
    is set up before the test's own fixtures), so it would tear down LAST -- after
    ``tmp_path`` cleanup had already tried to remove a directory the process was still
    sitting in. Windows refuses to delete a process's current working directory, so the
    cleanup fails there. Making the fixture depend on ``tmp_path`` would invert the order,

    exactly the per-test cost this change removed elsewhere. A ``tryfirst`` hookimpl runs
    before the default ``pytest_runtest_teardown``, which is what performs fixture
    finalization -- so the CWD is restored before ANY teardown, at no per-test cost.

    long-lived command -- is deliberately destructive to every record it then creates: it
    materializes ``msg`` and clears ``args`` so a handler cannot re-format, and it renders
    ``exc_info`` into ``exc_text`` and clears ``exc_info`` so a handler cannot re-render an
    unredacted traceback. Correct for redaction, and invisible to the test that leaves it
    installed, because the damage lands on whatever unrelated test later asserts on
    ``record.exc_info``, ``record.args``, or a deferred ``%s``.

    Measured: two tests failed this way in a release run and neither is a logging test --
    ``test_pid_lifecycle.py::TestFindOrphanMcpCandidates::
    test_unexpected_probe_error_keeps_traceback`` asserting a probe failure kept its
    traceback, and ``test_log_redaction`` itself hitting ``RecursionError`` because
    installing over the already-installed wrapper captured it as its own base factory.

    **Sharding hides this class, so the floor cannot rely on a full-suite run to find it.**
    ``ci.yml`` slices the suite into duration-balanced pytest-split groups and a leak only
    damages tests in the SAME process, so PR CI usually cannot observe it at all; the
    release job runs the suite whole and is otherwise the first place it appears -- as
    failures in files unrelated to the cause, long after the diff merged. Restoring here
    removes the class outright rather than improving the odds of noticing it.

    Restoring rather than failing is deliberate, for the same reason the CWD restore in
    ``pytest_runtest_teardown`` above does not blame either: installing this factory is a
    legitimate, unavoidable side effect of every test that drives the real ``cli.main()``
    or ``_setup_cli_logging`` in-process, which production does once per process and never
    undoes. Blaming them would demand pure bookkeeping with no test value, and the damage
    is to OTHER tests, so stopping it propagating is the whole job.
    ``log_redaction.uninstall_log_redaction()`` is there for a test that wants to assert on
    the uninstalled state itself; the install/uninstall contract is pinned by
    ``test_log_redaction.py``, not by this floor.

    The restore target is what this test INHERITED, not a pristine ``LogRecord``. That is
    what lets a higher-scoped fixture install one for the whole class or module without
    this floor tearing it out from under the second test, and it is also why this is a
    fixture rather than the cheaper ``pytest_runtest_teardown`` hookimpl the CWD restore
    uses: a conftest ``pytest_runtest_setup`` runs BEFORE the item's own fixtures, so its
    snapshot would miss such an installer and the teardown would then rip it out after the
    class's FIRST test. Measured cost of the fixture protocol over the hookimpl: ~50us per
    test, ~3s of CPU across the suite, spread over the xdist workers.

    The BOUNDARY that follows from the same choice: a class-, module- or session-scoped
    fixture that installs a factory and never removes it leaks PAST its own scope, because
    every later test inherits it and so restores to it. No fixture in this repo does that
    -- every installer sits in a test body, which is inside this fixture's window -- but a
    new higher-scoped one has to uninstall itself; the floor cannot tell that case from a

    ``command in _LONG_LIVED_COMMANDS`` branch, so every test that drives the real
    ``cli.main()`` for ``serve`` / ``gateway`` / ``chat`` leaks both. The factory half has
    been floored since it was found; this half was not, and it is the one the SHORT-LIVED
    branch then trips over. ``_setup_cli_logging("status", ...)`` takes the ``else`` path,
    which correctly never touches the global -- the listener a long-lived command started
    genuinely still exists -- so a test asserting "a short-lived verb starts no listener"
    reads the PREVIOUS test's listener and fails at its own first line.

    Measured: two tests in ``test_cli_logging.py`` assert that global is ``None`` after a
    short-lived setup -- ``TestDrainBeforeHardExit::test_no_listener_is_a_silent_no_op``
    and ``TestQueueOffLoop::test_short_lived_command_keeps_sync_handler`` -- and both go

    worker, reading ``assert <QueueListener object ...> is None``. That file's own
    ``_pristine_logging`` cannot absorb it: it clears the global in TEARDOWN only, which
    makes the file self-clean but leaves it defenceless against a leak that is already
    present at its SETUP. Under ``-n auto --dist loadgroup`` which worker an ordinary test
    lands on varies run to run, so it surfaces as an intermittent failure rather than a
    reproducible ordering bug -- it cost upstream PR #6798 a red ``Backend Tests (3.10, 1)``
    shard while ``(3.12, 1)`` passed at the identical commit.

    STOPPING rather than only reassigning, which is where this differs from the factory:
    the leak is a live daemon thread holding the file handler's open descriptor on a
    ``gateway.log`` under a ``tmp_path`` the next test deletes, so dropping the reference
    alone would clear the assertion and keep the thread and the fd. ``cli`` is reached
    through ``sys.modules`` rather than imported, as ``_no_leaked_telemetry_exporter``
    does: a worker that never imported it cannot hold a listener, and importing it here
    would charge every testpath ~0.5s and ~54MB for the ratchet in
    ``test_cli_lazy_imports.py`` to then measure in a subprocess anyway.

    Restoring rather than blaming, for the same reason as ``_restore_log_record_factory``
    above: starting the listener is what the entry point under test is FOR, and production
    starts it once per process and never undoes it. The damage is to OTHER tests, so
    stopping it propagating is the whole job.

    HANDLERS stay untouched, the boundary ``_restore_logger_levels`` below draws and for
    its reasons. The ``_CliLogQueueHandler`` left on the ``kiro_crew`` logger therefore
    outlives the listener it fed, holding an unattended queue; it is the same handler
    accumulation that fixture already records as a separate defect, and
    ``test_cli_logging.py``'s ``_pristine_logging`` is what absorbs it today by clearing
    both handler lists at setup.

    The restore target is what the test INHERITED, so a higher-scoped fixture that starts
    a listener for a whole class or module is not torn out from under its second test --
    and, as there, such a fixture has to stop its own listener, because every later test

    handler is routinely paired with a module-global that records it as installed --
    ``dashboard.handlers.updates._log_ring_handler_installed`` is the live example -- and
    a floor can detach the handler but cannot know to clear the flag. That leaves the
    module in a state neither a test nor production can otherwise reach: the singleton
    reports installed while nothing is attached, so the next caller is handed a handler
    that receives nothing. Restoring the ROOT logger's handler list is unsafe for a
    second, independent reason: pytest's ``catching_logs`` adds one per test PHASE and
    removes it at the phase boundary, so a list snapshotted during setup would be written
    back during teardown, re-attaching the setup phase's handler and dropping the one the
    teardown phase is capturing through.

    The handlers ``_setup_cli_logging`` leaves on ``kiro_crew`` do accumulate -- each open
    on a ``gateway.log`` under a ``tmp_path`` the next test deletes -- but that is a
    separate defect from this one, and it is not what empties ``caplog``.
    ``test_cli_logging.py``'s own ``_pristine_logging`` fixture is what absorbs it today,
    by clearing both handler lists at setup rather than by trusting its inheritance.

    Measured cost: ~30us per snapshot at ~450 live loggers, so ~60us per test.

    ``detect_backend()`` reached from a running event loop with a COLD cache
    deliberately refuses to probe -- the probe forks and waits, which must never
    happen on the loop -- and returns "none" with a self-described transient reason.
    Production fills the cache at gateway boot so that path is not reachable; a
    pytest worker has no boot, so the first async test to spawn through
    ``wrap_argv`` gets a hard ``SandboxUnavailableError`` reading "this host has no
    OS sandbox backend" on a host whose sandbox works perfectly.

    This lived in ``test/conftest.py``, which the in-package app suites never load,
    so the ~1490 tests under ``src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins/*/tests/`` had no warm
    cache at all -- 19 of them failed that way in a full run while every one passed
    when its own file was run alone. Whether an app test file happened to land on an
    xdist worker that had already run something under ``test/`` decided the verdict.

    Acting at SETUP rather than once per session is what makes it order-independent:
    the six ``test_sandbox_*.py`` files reset the cache in their own teardown
    (correctly -- they test the cache), and a session-scoped prewarm cannot undo that
    for whatever runs next on the worker.

    **RESTORING the first verdict, not re-probing.** A probe is not cheap on every
    host and its cost is not portable: it forks and then closes every inherited
    descriptor, which is O(``RLIMIT_NOFILE``) -- measured 1ms at a 1024 limit, 102ms
    at 524288 -- and on macOS it spawns a real ``sandbox-exec``. Re-probing per reset
    took ``test_sandbox_argv.py`` from 3.7s to 18.6s across its 145 tests. The answer
    cannot change within a process, so the second and later tests get the recorded
    one by assignment.

    Probing at most ONCE also bounds the transient case, which is the one that would
    otherwise be unbounded: a transient verdict is deliberately never cached, so
    "probe whenever cold" on a fork-starved host means two forks and a 50ms sleep for
    every test in the run. A probe failure is swallowed either way -- a host genuinely
    without a sandbox must still run the tests that do not need one.

    survive the run and accumulate across runs until they exhaust inodes -- MEASURED
    on this host, a ``/tmp`` tmpfs with a fixed 1,048,576-inode budget starts
    returning ENOSPC to unrelated processes with 90% of its BYTES still free.
    Enforcing that per call site is a contract every new test has to remember, and
    the shape that breaks it is invisible when reading the test:
    ``unittest.TestCase`` tearDown does NOT run when setUp raises, so a ``setUp:
    mkdtemp()`` paired with a ``tearDown: rmtree()`` leaks on every setUp failure --
    and it is the FAILING run, the one nobody is watching closely, that leaves the
    residue.

    Redirecting the base fixes the class instead of the call sites: whatever the suite
    creates without cleaning up lands in one directory this fixture owns, so the teardown
    can both NAME it (residue is still a defect) and REMOVE it (so the accumulation stops
    regardless of whether anyone acts on the report).

    The report WARNS by default and fails only under ``KIROCREW_TMP_RESIDUE_STRICT`` --
    see ``_TMP_RESIDUE_STRICT_ENV`` for why that is a staged rollout and not a shrug.

    Under ``-n auto`` each xdist worker is its own process, so each gets its own
    root and reports only its own leaks; the controller runs no tests and creates
    none.

    **A run only ever deletes the root it created itself.** There is deliberately no sweep
    of other roots, and that is a design decision rather than an omission. Reclaiming a
    root left by a killed run means deciding that some OTHER directory is abandoned, and
    every available signal for that is unsound: the name can be pre-created by another
    local account, and a pid is meaningless across PID namespaces -- two containers sharing
    a bind-mounted temp directory can each hold the same pid, so "that process is gone" is
    a statement about the wrong namespace and the reward for getting it wrong is deleting
    a live run's data. The platform already owns this job (``systemd-tmpfiles`` on a timer,
    macOS's periodic cleanup, and a tmpfs cleared on reboot), and it owns it with
    information this process does not have. So a run killed before its teardown leaves one
    directory behind for the platform to reclaim -- bounded, and far smaller than the
    375,780-inode-per-run accumulation this redirect removes.

    **Why the platform's own temp dir rather than pytest's ``basetemp``.** Nesting
    under ``basetemp`` would have been tidier -- pytest already prunes it -- but it
    adds ``pytest-of-<user>/pytest-<n>/popen-gw<k>/`` to the front of every
    ``mkdtemp()`` path in the suite, roughly 60 characters. Windows still caps a
    path at 260 unless long paths are enabled, and a macOS ``AF_UNIX`` ``sun_path``
    is capped at ~104 bytes, so that nesting would trade an inode leak for a
    platform-specific path-length failure. A sibling of the platform temp root named
    ``kc-pytest-<pid>`` is SHORTER than what pytest's own ``tmp_path`` already
    hands out, so no existing path gets longer on any platform.

    Two things deliberately stay outside the redirect:

    * ``test/tmpdir_helpers.short_tmp_base()`` forces ``/tmp`` on POSIX, because
      macOS's per-user temp root alone already exceeds the ``AF_UNIX`` cap. Those
      sites clean up after themselves.

    This lives at the rootdir rather than in ``test/conftest.py`` because the leak it
    closes is worst in the testpaths that conftest does not reach. The ~108 test
    modules under ``src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins/*/tests/`` ship inside the package and
    see only this file, so before this fixture existed here any of them that touched
    ``config_dir()`` resolved the operator's live data home -- and that resolution is
    not read-only: ``config_dir()`` CREATES the home and its marker on first use, and
    can run the one-time ``~/.kirocrew`` -> ``~/.kiro/crew`` migration as a side
    effect. Two of the eight app suites had grown their own redirect fixture; the
    other six had not, which is exactly the "remember to" contract this file exists to
    delete.

    A test that sets its own ``KIROCREW_HOME`` still wins: ``monkeypatch.setenv``
    applied later in setup overrides this, and reverts independently.

    ``config.paths._resolved_home`` is reset with it. ``config_dir()`` memoises the
    resolved home in that module global for the process lifetime, and under xdist one
    worker runs thousands of tests in one process, so a value cached by an earlier
    test would otherwise leak into a later one. Resetting it also invalidates
    ``_config_dir_memo``, which is keyed on that global by identity.

    ``KIROCREW_PROJECT_DIR`` is cleared for a different reason -- to match CI on a dev
    box. It is auto-set to the repo root when running from a checkout, so
    ``skills._project_skills_dir()`` resolves the repo's real ``skills/`` and a test
    driving ``_ensure_builtin_skills`` against a tmp dir sees live skills as a
    "source", flipping relocation behaviour: green in CI, red locally.

    ``KIROCREW_BOUND_PORT`` is cleared because ``_export_bound_port`` writes it into
    the real process environment when a test boots a server, so a port exported by one
    test would leak into every later test's port resolution on that worker.
    ``KIROCREW_DEV_MODE`` / ``KIROCREW_STRICT_ON_LOOP_PERSIST`` are cleared so a
    developer who exports them does not flip the off-loop-IO guards strict for the
    whole suite.

    ``KIRO_HOME`` is deliberately NOT pinned here, even though the lazy
    ``config.paths.kiro_home()`` does name the operator's real machine-wide kiro-cli
    home. The env var takes precedence over ``Path.home()`` by design, and ~35 tests
    isolate that resolver the other way round -- ``patch("pathlib.Path.home",
    return_value=tmp_path)`` -- so pinning the variable overrides their own isolation
    and they read an empty directory instead of the tree they just built. A test that
    reaches ``kiro_home()`` therefore isolates it itself, with whichever of the two
    levers it already uses.

    ``KIROCREW_WORKSPACE`` is pinned alongside ``KIROCREW_HOME`` for the same
    reason as the rest of this fixture: ``config.loader.workspace_root()`` is its
    own default, independent of ``config_dir()`` -- with no override and no saved
    ``<config_dir>/workspace_dir`` file it falls back to the platform's
    ``_default_workspace_base()`` plus ``kirocrew-workspace``, which on Linux/macOS
    is the operator's real ``~/workplace``. Any test that reaches an agent working
    directory (``workspace_root()``, ``_session_work_dir()``, ``outbox_dir()``)
    without setting its own ``KIROCREW_WORKSPACE`` therefore ``mkdir``s and writes
    into that real tree. Unlike ``config_dir()``, ``workspace_root()`` reads the env
    var fresh on every call and caches nothing, so there is no module-global memo to
    reset here -- setting the variable is the whole fix.

    SEL is a process SINGLETON whose writer is a DAEMON THREAD, and

    resolved at that moment. Two consequences, and the second is why this belongs at
    the rootdir rather than in ``test/conftest.py``:

    * Every event any test emits through the default ``sel()`` appends to ONE file.
      Unredirected that is the operator's real ``security_events.jsonl`` -- a
      non-atomic append, shared across xdist workers.
    * Whichever test calls ``sel()`` FIRST fixes the directory for the whole
      process, and the writer thread keeps using it after that test ends. When the
      first caller is a test whose home is a per-test tmp dir, the thread outlives
      the tmp dir and RE-CREATES it on the next flush -- ``_flush_batch`` opens with
      ``self._dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)``. So the directory reappears
      *after* the test's own cleanup removed it, and no amount of tidying in the
      test can win against a thread that rebuilds the path. MEASURED: this is
      exactly what left one stray ``mkdtemp`` directory behind per run of the
      ops-mission-control suite. Full telling:
      ``docs/system-specs/common/testing-conventions.md`` § Rules.

    Session scope is what fixes both: the thread's directory is stable for the whole
    run and belongs to no individual test, so nothing deletes it underneath the
    writer, and the thread is not churned per test.

    Patches the ``_default_dir()`` accessor rather than a captured constant, because
    the module resolves its default lazily so that importing ``kiro_crew.sel`` never
    triggers the one-time data-home migration as an import side effect. Tests that

    SEL directory, which is the right default tier: the writer is a daemon
    thread on a process singleton, and a per-test ``tmp_path`` would be deleted
    underneath it (see that fixture's docstring). But one shared root also
    means one shared CHAIN LOCK, and a test whose assertion transitively

    a concurrent writer it never created — the loop-side acquire is a single
    non-blocking attempt by design (issue #7029, the issue-radar trust flake).

    This is the per-test tier of the same seam. It rebinds the singleton to a
    fresh directory nothing else writes, so no other test — on this worker or
    any other — can hold this test's chain lock:

    * The directory comes from ``tmp_path_factory``, whose numbered dirs are
      never deleted mid-run (a lingering writer can never resurrect a removed
      path) and whose basetemp is already per-xdist-worker (``popen-gwN``), so
      the isolation holds across workers as well as across tests.
    * The instance is built ``sync=True``: every event is written inline on its
      caller's thread and NO background writer starts, so the only writers on
      this root are the test's own threads — which the module-level chain-hold
      registry already lets join one another.
    * ``_default_dir()`` is deliberately NOT repointed: the displaced shared
      directory stays reachable through it, which is what lets a differential
      test hold the SHARED root's lock and prove this test no longer contends
      for it.

    which MCP servers exist, and ``kiro_agents_dir()`` is a LAZY resolver
    (``kiro_home()`` -> ``$KIRO_HOME`` or ``Path.home()/.kiro``), so neither
    ``KIROCREW_HOME`` nor ``_SHARED_KIRO_PATHS`` reaches it -- the shared-path ratchet's
    own docstring records that lazy resolvers are outside its scope.

    Without this, any test reaching the write path (``rebuild_agent_config`` and the
    per-agent writers around it, ``apps.bridges._register_agents``) rewrites the
    operator's machine-wide ``<kiro home>/agents/kirocrew.json``. Confirmed live
    (#4912): a suite run inside a throwaway clone left every managed server's
    ``command`` pointing into that clone's venv and pinned the per-test data home into
    their ``env``, because ``_managed_mcp_env`` stamps the WRITER's paths. Both stop
    existing when the run ends, so afterwards every new session on the machine spawned
    ``kirocrew-core`` from a deleted venv against a data home recreated empty ->
    ``read_local_secret()`` returned "" -> every internal HTTP call failed
    ``internal_auth_mismatch`` (``received=absent``), killing ``spawn_run``,
    ``learn_add`` and ``cron_*`` while in-process tools kept working. A gateway restart
    healed it, and the next suite run re-broke it, which is what made it look
    intermittent and unfixable.

    ``KIRO_HOME`` is NOT the lever used here, deliberately -- see
    ``_isolate_kirocrew_home`` for why pinning that variable is refused: ~35 tests
    isolate ``kiro_home()`` the other way round with
    ``patch("pathlib.Path.home", ...)``, and an env pin overrides their own isolation
    so they read an empty directory instead of the tree they just built. Pinning the
    per-module seams instead leaves both of those levers untouched.

    One directory for every entry, not one each: production resolves a single agents
    dir, so a test that writes a spec through one seam and reads it through another
    (``rebuild_agent_config`` then ``agent_discovery``) has to see the same tree.

    Unlike ``_isolate_shared_kiro_paths``, the HOOK half does not settle for patching
    whatever happens to be in ``sys.modules``. That fixture's residual hole -- a module
    first imported inside a test's own body, after the fixture already ran -- is
    tolerable for a path that is only read, and not for these: ``rebuild_agent_config``
    and ``apps.bridges._register_agents`` WRITE, and a test that imports its subject in
    its own body is a normal shape here. ``_agent_spec_seam_modules`` therefore imports
    those four once per worker process. MEASURED cold on this tree: agent 177 ms,
    cli_doctor 87 ms, bridges 33 ms, agent_discovery 19 ms -- ~315 ms per worker for a
    whole session, against a shard that runs for minutes. Per-TEST import would have

    ``KIRO_HOME`` -- the documented env override, which several tests use to place the

    resolver installed here. Deferring is safe because the variable is CLEARED first,
    so anything visible afterwards was chosen by the test rather than exported by the

# ── Check-run annotations that name the failing test (issue #7296) ──────────
#
# A red shard is read from its check run's ANNOTATIONS, not from the log: that
# is what the PR page shows, what a fork contributor sees, and all that survives
# in a triage report. Nothing in this repo wrote one, so the annotations came
# from the `python` problem matcher that `actions/setup-python` registers by
# default, whose pattern is a traceback frame (`File "...", line N, in f`)
# followed by `raise SomeError('msg')`.
#
# MEASURED on the six Backend Tests jobs cited in #7296: that pattern matched
# pytest's WARNINGS SUMMARY every time and a pytest failure not once. All six
# reds were annotated only `Event loop is closed` at line 545 -- which is
# `asyncio/base_events.py:545` inside `_check_closed`, reached from a
# `PytestUnraisableExceptionWarning` about a garbage-collected coroutine, i.e. a
# WARNING. The reds themselves were ordinary named failures (a `git add`
# timeout, a missing diag.jsonl, sandbox-dependent project tests) and appeared
# in no annotation at all. Four unrelated PRs were triaged as an event-loop
# teardown flake on the strength of that, and the class had been "fixed" four
# times before.
#
# Replacing the matcher with a better matcher is not the fix. `--color=yes` is
# in the addopts, so the summary line a matcher would have to scrape reads
# `\x1b[31mFAILED\x1b[0m test/x.py::\x1b[1mtest_y\x1b[0m - AssertionError: ...`
# with escape sequences INSIDE the node id. The report objects already carry the
# path, the line and the node id as data, so the annotation is emitted from them
# here and nothing is parsed back out of rendered output.

#: Failures that get their own annotation before the rest are only counted.
#: GitHub keeps a bounded number per check run and drops the excess with no
#: notice, so past this point the annotation list stops being something anyone
#: reads and the short test summary in the log is the better artifact.
_MAX_ANNOTATED_FAILURES = 10

#: a page long, does not fit the check-run UI, and is already in the log.
