# KiroCrew container entrypoint.
#
# Responsibilities (deliberately minimal — real logic lives in the product):
#
#   1. Sync channel credentials out of the process environment.
#      Compose/`docker run -e` deliver SLACK_BOT_TOKEN etc. as container
#      env, which would otherwise sit in the gateway's /proc/<pid>/environ
#      for the container's whole life, readable by any same-UID process
#      (execve-time snapshot — runtime scrubs don't clean it). The
#      entrypoint moves each credential into the product's supported
#      credential file (<config dir>/.env, chmod 600) and unsets it BEFORE
#      exec'ing the gateway, so the gateway's environ snapshot never
#      contains a credential. The gateway loads .env natively; process env
#      would have overridden .env anyway, so last-write-wins semantics are
#      preserved for operators who change a value and restart.
#
#   2. Decide the sandbox posture on first run — by PROBING, not assuming.
#      The agent exec guard is fail-closed: with no sandbox backend and no
#      explicit opt-out it refuses to run agent commands. Whether the inner
#      Linux user-namespace backend works INSIDE a container depends on the
#      runtime's seccomp/AppArmor policy (modern Docker default profiles
#      permit unshare; hardened ones don't). So on a genuine first run:
#        - probe the product's own backend detector;
#        - if a backend works: seed NOTHING — the inner sandbox stays ON
#          and agent subprocesses cannot read gateway-owned files/environ;
#        - only if no backend works: seed
#          agent.sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec=true (the container itself
#          remains the OS isolation boundary) and say so loudly, including
#          how to get the inner sandbox back (a seccomp profile permitting
#          user namespaces + delete the key).
#      First-run only: an existing config.json is operator-owned — never
#      rewrite it, only print guidance. "First run" means config.json is
#      absent (an EMPTY mounted volume is still a first run).
#
#   3. Print how to mint a dashboard login link. Fresh links are minted via
#      docker exec rather than parsed out of logs: the gateway's own startup
#      link (printed once at boot, same as every platform) expires minutes
#      after minting, so anything found in `docker logs` later is dead.
#
# Contract: `docker run <image>` starts the gateway; any explicit args are
# passed through to the kirocrew CLI instead (e.g. `docker run <image>
# doctor`, `docker exec <ctr> kirocrew-entrypoint gateway --slack-only`).

# from the backend twice in review; delegating closes the entire divergence
# class — the entrypoint writes exactly where the gateway will read, by
# construction. KIROCREW_HOME itself passes through unmodified — the backend
# applies the identical interpretation to it.
