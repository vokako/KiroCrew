"""check_harness_parity.py — keep the Kiro harness first-class on lines a change adds.

Kiro Crew drives one first-class agent harness, ``kiro-cli``
(``ACP_BACKEND_KIRO``, spelled ``""``), plus adapted ones: the
``ACP_BACKEND_CLAUDE`` seam, KAS, and whatever a bring-your-own adapter
registers next. An added harness may only adapt itself to the seams the Kiro
harness already runs through; it may not move, widen, or generalize them.

The defect class this gate catches is *silent capture*: a call site that spells
"this is Kiro" as the ABSENCE of another harness. It reads correctly with two
backends and then hands harness number three a capability, a sandbox waiver, or
a session label nobody granted it — and it fails toward the permissive answer,
so nothing goes red. Two such sites shipped before this gate existed
(``AcpProvider.is_session_sharing_eligible`` and ``AcpRuntime.spawn``'s
``is_kiro_cli``); both were one-line positive-test fixes.

The invariants, their ids, and what pins each one:
docs/system-specs/modules/harness-parity.md. Rules here enforce group B (H5-H8);
the structural invariants are pinned by ``test/test_harness_parity.py``.

## Why diff-scoped and not whole-tree

The tree carries eleven pre-existing negative identity tests, most of them in
the claude seam, and converting them all is a separate change with its
own review. A whole-tree gate would fail every PR until that lands and charge
the break to whoever pushed next. Added lines are complete for regression — a
line only reaches ``main`` through a diff that added it — and the whole-tree
count is still printed as a non-failing report so the backlog stays visible.

## Usage

    # enforce on what this branch adds (exit 1 on any violation)
    HARNESS_BASE_REF=origin/main python3 scripts/check_harness_parity.py

    # report the whole-tree backlog, enforce nothing (exit 0)
    python3 scripts/check_harness_parity.py

    # scan explicit files, ignoring git entirely
    python3 scripts/check_harness_parity.py src/kiro_crew/acp/runtime.py

    # self-test: plant one probe per rule, assert each verdict
    python3 scripts/check_harness_parity.py --test

## Escape hatch

A line the rules below model wrongly can opt out with a ``harness-ok`` marker in
a trailing comment, followed by the reason. It is unscoped and silences the
whole line, so a reviewer should ask why the positive form does not work.
