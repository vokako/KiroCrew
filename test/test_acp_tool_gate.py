"""The tool gate reports routing honestly and refuses what it enforces.

Two axes that must not be conflated, and each test names which one it is on:

* **Truth** -- what :func:`routing_verdict` SAYS about a harness. Every harness
  gets an honest verdict, including the ones this core does not enforce.
* **Enforcement** -- whether a non-ROUTED verdict REFUSES. Scoped to the
  mechanisms this core implements end to end, which today is ``SESSION_CONFIG``
  only.

Collapsing them is the failure this file exists to prevent: upgrading an
unenforced harness to ``ROUTED`` so it stops refusing would make the picker and
the doctor row assert a guarantee nothing performs.

Every test is revert-verified: with the corresponding guard removed they fail.

    host-specific remedy text, so guarding twice only blurred the diagnostic. That
    made the verdict depend on ``_allow_unsandboxed_exec()`` -- MUTABLE config, read
    at preflight and acted on at the spawn. Flipping it on in that window left a
    session that had already passed the guard taking wrap_argv's unwrapped path with
    the credential paths readable, so the verdict must not consult it at all.
