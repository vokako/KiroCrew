"""The banned-process line carries the running process's age.

The ``BANNED`` line the fleet probe emits carries ``age=<secs>s`` (or ``age=?s``
when the age is unavailable), derived at scan time from ``/proc/<pid>/stat`` field
22 plus ``os.sysconf`` for the clock tick rate. An age that grows across cycles
marks one process still alive; a small age under a re-appearing pid marks a fresh
violation on a recycled pid number. The age is a fact about the running process,
so it costs no state file and no second writer, and the probe stays read-only
outside ``--mark-handled``.

The field is never omitted. Where ``/proc``/``os.sysconf`` are absent (Windows)
the helper returns None and the caller emits ``age=?s``, so a reader sees an
explicit unknown instead of assuming the process is new. These tests drive the
probe over a fake ``/proc`` (the ``KIROCREW_PROBE_PROC_ROOT`` seam the script
exposes) and also pin the no-tick-rate path directly.
