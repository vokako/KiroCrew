"""Tests for the kiro_cli_logs reader (diagnostics.read_kiro_cli_logs) + MCP tool.

Two security-critical properties, and both have a mutation guard so a green run
is attributable to the code rather than to the fixture:

1. SCOPE. The tool reads kiro-cli's mcp/lsp PROTOCOL logs only. The two
   conversation-bearing sources kiro-cli also writes — ``kiro-chat.log`` and the
   ``sessions/cli/<sid>.jsonl`` transcripts — are single shared host files per
   gateway, so returning either would disclose another session's private
   conversation to the calling session; the credential-oriented redaction stack
   does not narrow prose. ``test_chat_log_is_not_a_source`` plants a populated
   chat log and asserts none of it comes back.
2. REDACTION. Every live-secret shape kiro-cli writes into its logs — a bearer
   token, a mid-line ``Authorization: Basic <b64>`` header, an ``mc_token`` auth
   cookie, and the serialized ``"authorization": ...`` JSON form — must be gone
   from the returned text. ``test_redaction_is_load_bearing`` empties the extra
   stack and asserts the very same secrets then leak, so the passing assertion
   is not vacuous.
