    """A required review status must never be satisfied by the OTHER lane's run.

    Each AI review is published by two workflows: the same-repo lane and the
    privileged Stage-2 ``fork-*-review.yml``. GitHub resolves a required status
    check to the NEWEST check-run of that name, and on a fork PR the same-repo
    lane reviews nothing. While the two lanes share a name, any
    ``pull_request`` event firing after the fork lane posted its verdict (a
    reopen; an ``edited`` title/body on codex-review) makes the same-repo
    lane's own run the newest one and clears the gate on a review that never
    ran. The same-repo lane therefore renames itself on a fork PR, leaving
    exactly one publisher of the protected name per PR type.

    That rename only renders because the fork guard sits on every STEP rather
    than on the job: GitHub does not evaluate a skipped job's ``name:``, so a
    job-level guard published the raw expression source as the fork PR's check
    name. The per-step gate is therefore load-bearing for the name AND the only
    thing keeping fork content out of this privileged lane, so it is asserted
    step by step -- a step added later without it would execute on a fork.

class TestReviewLaneVerdictVisibility:
    """No review lane may bury a posted verdict under an incomplete body (#8344).

    Covers the eight lanes that upsert a marker-keyed summary comment outside
    codex-review.yml. Each lane defines the guarded upsert as a byte-identical
    ``guarded_comment_upsert`` bash function; the identity test pins every
    copy to one canonical body so the invariant cannot drift lane by lane, and
    the behavioral tests run each lane's REAL step bash with a stubbed ``gh``
    for the contract cases.

    The guarded transition is a NO-TOUCH, not a merge: a run whose body
    carries no ``"<stamp> <head>"`` proof marker leaves an existing comment
    entirely alone. Reading the body and PATCHing a merge of it back would
    reopen the same class of loss from the other side, because runs for
    different heads are not cancelled — a verdict published between the read
    and the write is restored away.
