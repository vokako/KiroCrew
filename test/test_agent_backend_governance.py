"""The ``agent_backend`` governance scope — additive over a floor, applied at boot.

Two questions decide whether a harness can be selected, and these tests pin the seam
between them: ``acp_backends.selectable_backends`` answers "can this BUILD serve it"
(a capability fact, not governable) and this scope answers "may THIS DEPLOYMENT
select it".

The semantics under test is the decision #6622 was blocked on: an ``allow`` list ADDS
to the floor rather than replacing the set, so no policy can leave an install with no
startable harness.

The ENFORCEMENT POSITION is equally load-bearing and is pinned here too. Policy
narrows the registry once at boot; nothing downstream gains a check. That is what
keeps selectability at one gate (harness-parity H4), keeps the single gate free of a
platform-context read that would re-enter the config load (H3), and keeps the Kiro
construction path free of an adapter-driven conditional (H13).
