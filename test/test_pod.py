    test paths:

    ``unit.unit_path`` — a test reaching ``install_unit`` (via ``_up`` ->
    ``install_backend``, or the ``start_pod`` self-heal) rewrites the REAL
    ``kirocrew-pod@.service`` with this test's tmpdir as
    ``Environment=KIROCREW_POD_ROOT=``. Every later ``pod up`` on the host then dies
    with "no pinned checkout", so running the suite breaks pods for everyone until
    someone re-runs ``pod install``. Observed on a real host.

    ``PodConfig.pods_dir`` — resolves off the DEFAULT data home on purpose (a pod
    process must not be able to redirect the host's pod registry into its own
    throwaway home). The per-name lifecycle mutex writes its lock file there.

    Pinning ``HOME`` fixes the cause both share instead of patching each function
    that reads it, so a future path that resolves through the home is covered
    without a matching change here. ``USERPROFILE`` too, because Windows
    ``Path.home()`` reads that one. Tests that pin either themselves still win.

    The ``.aws/sso/cache`` corridor is CREATED (the pod's own kiro-cli writes its
    MCP OAuth grants there) and deliberately left EMPTY: nothing is copied from the
    host. An earlier revision staged the host's SSO tokens into it, which a security
    review blocked -- the carve-out that keeps the corridor writable also exposed
    those copied HOST bearer tokens to any agent shell in the pod, and live
    acceptance had already shown the copy was not load-bearing (sign-in comes from
    the runtime's own data store, ``_RUNTIME_AUTH_STORES``). These tests pin the
    absence of that copy; the tests that used to pin its presence are inverted here.

    ``Path.home()`` inside these tests resolves to the module's autouse
    per-test ``HOME`` pin, not the real invoking user's home -- see the
    fixture at the top of this file. Tests populate THAT pinned real home's
