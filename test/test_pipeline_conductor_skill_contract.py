"""The pipeline-conductor skill's contract, pinned against its own text.

The conductor's decisions live in two places: the bundled scripts, which are
testable as code, and the skill body, which was testable nowhere until this file
existed. That asymmetry is what this file closes. A clause the scripts depend on
-- the exit-code branch table for the claim preflight, the ``TERMINAL`` action,
the delivery counters that size admission -- can be dropped by a well-meaning
rewrite of a markdown file and nothing anywhere goes red, so the procedure and
the scripts silently stop agreeing.

The assertions are deliberately about SUBSTANCE, not sentences, and the dividing
line is stated so a later edit has a rule to follow: assert a phrase when it
states a RULE -- an obligation, a prohibition, a defined behavior, a name the
scripts share -- and do NOT assert one that only explains WHY the rule exists.
Rationale is what a rewrite is entitled to reword; pinning it produces a typo
detector that every legitimate edit has to fight, which is the failure mode that
makes text tests get deleted.

The prompt is read from the module constant rather than by running the
installer: ``test_pipeline_conductor_agent.py`` already proves that constant
reaches the written agent config, and re-stubbing the installer here would
couple this file to that one for no additional coverage.
