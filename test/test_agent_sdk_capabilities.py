"""The capability mechanism lives inside the boundary, and answers what it used to.

Three things this file is responsible for, and they fail for different reasons:

1. **Nothing outside the boundary asks a backend's IDENTITY any more.** RFC PR 3's
   exit condition. An identity branch hands each new harness whichever arm the old
   comparison happened to leave behind, so the six that moved must not come back
   and no seventh may appear in the files they lived in.
2. **Every answer is the answer ``origin/main`` gave.** The move is a refactor, so
   each routing verdict, permission config, membership and capability field is
   pinned to a literal copied from a clean main checkout -- ``codex`` and an
   unknown id included, because a fail-closed answer that quietly became
   fail-open is the failure this class of change actually risks.
3. **Every capability set has a recorded disposition.** A set with no row in
   ``agent_sdk/backends``'s docstring is a set nobody decided about, and the next
   reader exposes a driver-internal membership as a consumer-facing question.

The scans are AST-based, so a set name inside a docstring or a comment is not a
read. That matters here: several of these files keep prose EXPLAINING the identity
check they used to make, and a text scan would either fail on that prose or force
it to be deleted -- and deleting the reason is how the next change re-introduces
the branch.

    Round 1's GPT lane asked for ``capabilities`` on the ``LLMProvider`` ABC, so a
    non-``AcpProvider`` implementation could not fall through to unknown defaults.
    Falling through IS the previous behaviour: the six predicates were
    ``isinstance(provider, AcpProvider) and provider.is_claude_backend``, so a
    foreign provider already answered the conservative default. This pins that
    equivalence against a REAL ``LLMProvider`` subclass rather than a bare object,
