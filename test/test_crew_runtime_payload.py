"""The AWS Control crew image's build context must reach every install lane.

The image is built from files on disk: two Dockerfiles, ``requirements.txt`` and
``requirements-dev.txt``, ``CONTRACT.md``, and a vendor placeholder. If any of them is
absent from an installed copy, the build fails at image-build time with a missing file --
long after the install that dropped it, and with nothing in the install output saying so.

Two lanes select these files by DIFFERENT mechanisms and can drop them independently, so
each is pinned separately. This follows ``test_vendored_llama_payload.py``, which exists
because exactly one of these lanes silently shipped a broken wheel:

* the **sdist**, governed by ``MANIFEST.in``. ``python -m build`` builds the wheel FROM the
  sdist, so a file this file does not reach is absent from every published wheel whatever
  ``package_data`` says. ``python -m build --wheel`` never evaluates ``MANIFEST.in`` at all,
  so a wheel-only build cannot observe a regression here.
* the **wheel**, governed by ``[options.package_data]`` in ``setup.cfg``. A pattern there
  globs by fixed directory name, and ``*`` does not cross a path separator, so an entry
  written for ``apps/builtins/*/`` does not descend into ``aws_control/crew/runtime/``.

Neither lane is reached by the patterns that were already present: the tree's Python files
are found by ``packages = find:``, its ``.md`` files by
``recursive-include src/kiro_crew/apps *.md``, and its Dockerfiles by nothing, because they
have no suffix to match.

These tests MODEL both files rather than executing them, which makes them the weaker half
of the defence by construction -- ``build.yml`` builds the real sdist and wheel. The
stronger alternative here, shelling out to ``python -m build``, skips wherever ``build`` is
missing, and a skip scores as a pass, so the guard would be absent exactly where it matters.
