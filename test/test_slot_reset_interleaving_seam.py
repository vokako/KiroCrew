"""The test-only interleaving seam, and the reload-vs-switch race it reaches.

``chat_handlers._test_interleave`` is awaited at four named points across the
session-teardown paths. These tests pin its contract -- unset by default, called
with the point names in the order the code reaches them -- and then use it for the
thing it exists for: driving a reload's teardown into the middle of a switch
handler's commit-then-reset span, deterministically, with no sleep.

That interleaving is what reload joining the same two locks the switch
handlers hold now closes: the tests named for it below assert the serialized
outcome -- the second racer blocks on the session lock while the first holds
it. See their docstrings.
