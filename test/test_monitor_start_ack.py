"""The monitor_start acknowledgement must state the loop's real cadence.

Gating is inferred from the instruction, so two loops armed through the SAME call
with the same interval can have different cadences. The ack is the only thing the
arming agent reads back, so if it promises a plain per-interval re-injection for a
loop that will actually be observed-and-gated, the change is invisible exactly
where it is decided -- which is the failure this whole feature exists to undo.
