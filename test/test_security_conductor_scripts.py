"""The security conductor's three evaluator scripts -- the properties, not the plumbing.

Each test pins one guarantee the RFC asks a SCRIPT to hold rather than asking an
agent to hold it: a scope verdict whose precedence is fixed, an ``UNKNOWN`` that
is never permission, one finding per real defect, and a verifier that refuses a
proof of concept the rules of engagement forbid instead of running it.

Every script is driven through ``main`` with argv, the way the skill invokes it,
because the exit code IS the interface -- a property that holds only in a helper
called directly would not be the one the conductor reads.
