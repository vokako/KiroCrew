"""The rootdir conftest's isolation floor guards itself.

``test_host_service_guard.py`` covers the SERVICE half of that floor. This file covers
the three halves added around it, each of which protects a different piece of the
operator's machine from a test that forgot to isolate itself:

* the **data home** -- ``KIROCREW_HOME`` pinned per test, plus the ``~/.kiro`` paths
  production binds at IMPORT time, which the env var cannot reach;
* the **workspace root** -- ``KIROCREW_WORKSPACE`` pinned per test, a SEPARATE
  default from the data home that otherwise resolves to the operator's real
  ``~/workplace``;
* the **system temp directory** -- ``tempfile``'s base redirected per run, with residue
  reported rather than silently accumulated;
* the **worker budget** -- how many xdist workers the host can actually back.

Two jobs, the same split ``test_host_service_guard.py`` uses:

* **Behaviour** -- prove each guard is armed, catches what it claims, and stays silent
  on what it must not touch. A guard nobody exercises is a guard that stops working at
  the next refactor without anybody noticing.
* **Ratchet** -- pin the guarded set against what ``src/kiro_crew`` actually contains,
  so a NEW import-time ``Path.home()`` binding cannot land unpinned. Same shape as
  ``test_host_service_guard.py``'s ratchet and ``test_spawn_preexec_guard.py``'s
  ``_ALLOWED``.
