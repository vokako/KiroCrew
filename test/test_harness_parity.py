"""Structural pins for the harness-parity invariants.

Kiro Crew drives one first-class harness, ``kiro-cli``, and adapts the others.
Each test here closes one invariant from
``docs/system-specs/modules/harness-parity.md`` by its id, so a change that
degrades the Kiro path goes red here rather than at an operator's first message.

Two invariants (H13, H14) are properties of a *change* rather than of a tree and
have no deterministic form; they are carried by the ``harness-parity`` rule in
``AUTOSDE.yaml``. The added-line half of H5 lives in
``scripts/check_harness_parity.py`` and is exercised by its ``--test`` mode,
which :func:`test_added_line_gate_self_test_passes` runs.
