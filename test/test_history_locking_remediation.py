"""Regression tests for the Cluster-B ``history.py`` audit remediation.

Each test class reproduces one audited failure scenario:

1. Cross-process advisory ``flock`` covering append / read-rewrite so a writer
   in ANOTHER process (subagent, cron, CLI) can't silently lose updates.
2. ``_tab_id_index`` invalidated on append/metadata + removal of the permanent
   ``[]`` sentinel that hid sessions created after the first chained read.
3. Consolidation offset recomputed (clamped) when a rotation fired during the
   LLM await, so post-rotation messages aren't silently skipped.
4. Oversized files rotate even when they have ``<= _SESSION_KEEP_LINES`` lines
   (a few huge messages), instead of growing without bound.
5. ``delete_session`` uses ``unlink(missing_ok=True)`` and tolerates a
   concurrent removal instead of raising ``FileNotFoundError``.
6. One-line metadata rewrites no longer ``fsync`` while holding the lock,
   shrinking the critical section every other writer contends on.
