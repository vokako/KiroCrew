"""``agent.acp_backend`` is writable from the dashboard, and only to real backends.

The Developer > Agent Backend switch writes this field over
``PATCH /api/config/kirocrew``, so it has to be in ``_EDITABLE_CONFIG`` at all —
before this it was absent and every save came back "field not editable".

The load-bearing tests here used to be PARITY ones: three unrelated places each
kept a literal copy of the selectable-backend list, and these tests stood in for a
code owner. They no longer can. The set is a REGISTRY an edition extends at boot
(``register_selectable_backend``), which no import-time literal can see. So what is
pinned now is that each surface RESOLVES the set at request time from the one
owner, ``agent_sdk.backends``, rather than carrying its own answer.

    the exclusion removed was the switch. If a backend is ever taken back out, the
