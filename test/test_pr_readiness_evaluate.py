"""Behavioural tests for pr-readiness.yml's evaluate-step transport resilience.

Issue #2753: every read-only ``gh`` call in the readiness evaluation was
single-shot inside a fail-fast shell step, so one transient network/TLS error
aborted the job before the publish step could run -- the same commit was
observed evaluating green then red 39 seconds apart with nothing pushed.

These tests extract the real "Evaluate current revision" script (plus the
retry-helper install step it sources) and execute them with ``gh`` replaced by
a stub, verifying the three properties that matter:

1. A transient failure is retried and the evaluation still reaches its REAL
   verdict (the retry helper works and does not corrupt piped output).
2. A persistent transport failure produces the explicit NON-TERMINAL
   "could not be evaluated" verdict (pending / ``readiness: checking``) and
   exit 0 -- never a red check.
3. A genuine failing workflow conclusion still produces the terminal red
   ``action required`` verdict -- the fallback must not suppress real reds.

Skipped where the POSIX toolchain the script needs (bash, jq) is unavailable,
mirroring test_pr_readiness_sweep.py.

class _ForkLaneVerdictBinding:
    """A fork lane verdict must belong to THIS pull request and THIS attempt.

    Two open PRs can share a head SHA -- the same fork branch opened against two
    bases, or the same commit in two forks -- and each Stage-2 lane posts a
    check-run under the SAME NAME on that SHA. A RERUN on an unchanged head also
    leaves the previous attempt's completed row in place while the new attempt is
    still starting. Reading rows by name alone loses both ways, and the second one
    is not even a narrow race: readiness recomputes on the trigger's completion,
    which is exactly when the old row is the only one there.

    Staleness is not merely cosmetic here. A model verdict can differ between
    attempts on the same head, so accepting the previous attempt's clean verdict
    can pass content a rerun would judge differently. The lane therefore stamps
    external_id=<prefix><pr>-<run id>-<attempt>, and readiness derives the
    expected value from the newest run of the triggering workflow (Fast Gate).

    Subclasses set PREFIX to their lane's `<lane>-pr-` and CHECK_NAME to the
    lane's check-run name. The stub serves check_runs.json for EVERY check-name
    query, so every lane reads the same row -- only the lane under test is
    attempt-bound to a matching id, and the others read a non-matching id and
    fall to pending, which is fine because only the tested lane's outcome is
    asserted.
