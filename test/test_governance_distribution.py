"""Central policy distribution — one ceiling, followed by the whole fleet.

Covers ``governance.PolicyDistribution`` (the parsed declaration), the
``platform.policy_distribution`` engine (source resolution, the transport seam,
the last-known-good cache, the boot dispositions and the live refresh), the
tier's place in ``load_security_policy``'s precedence, and the keystone that
keeps the cache unwritable by the agent.

**Nothing here touches the network.** Every transport case either registers a
fake fetcher through the public ``register_policy_fetcher`` seam or drives a
``file://`` source under ``tmp_path``; the one plain-``http`` case is refused
before a socket is opened. Patching ``urllib.request.urlopen`` would NOT
intercept this module — it opens through the named ``_open`` seam.
