"""Tests for the CI surface-test selector (``scripts/ci-surface-tests.py``).

The selector decides which tests must still run when a diff touches only ONE
surface. Its contract is **deny-by-default**: it may only skip a file it can
positively prove is single-surface, so a heuristic miss costs CI time rather
than silently dropping a cross-surface parity guard.

These tests pin that contract, because the failure mode they guard against is
invisible: a guard quietly stops running and the drift it protects against
ships green.
