"""Close-vs-expiry race on the dashboard slot-delete handler.

The defect these pin: ``api_chat_slot_delete`` retired the slot's auto-nudge
loop only AFTER it had persisted the closure and torn down the session. Both of
those are awaits, and the slot is already out of ``state._slots`` by then — so a
loop whose idle timer expired inside one of them found no live slot, took the
fire path's rehydrate branch (``adopt_closed=True``) and restored the transcript
the persist had just marked closed. The session the user dismissed came back,
carrying a transcript that outlived its own closure.

Retiring the loop before the first await also closes a second door: cancelling
``slot.task`` runs ``_run_chat``'s finally, which re-arms the timer through
``notify_turn_complete``. Disarming without removing is not enough.

The mirror bug matters as much: the close can still FAIL (the history persist
raises, and the handler restores the slot and answers 500). A loop retired for a
close that never happened would leave an unattended worker running with no clock
at all, so the failure path puts a replacement back — carrying the REMAINING
budget, never a fresh one.
