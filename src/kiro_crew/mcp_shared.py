# ── Private stdout descriptor for JSON-RPC responses ───────────────────────
# The vendored llama-cpp runtime wraps its multi-second GGUF model load in
# ``suppress_stdout_stderr``, which does a PROCESS-WIDE ``dup2(devnull, 1)``
# for the duration of the load (``_vendor/llama_cpp/_utils.py``). The first
# ``local_knowledge_search`` kicks that load on a background thread and returns
# a keyword-only result in milliseconds, so the JSON-RPC response for that very
# call races the load window. Written through fd 1, the bytes land in
# /dev/null: no exception, no short write, the SEL audit still records
# ``success`` -- and the client waits forever until the ACP tool-stall watchdog
# (``acp/client.py::_TOOL_STALL_TIMEOUT``, 600s) kills the turn.
#
# ``snapshot_stdout_fd()`` takes an ``os.dup(1)`` at server startup, BEFORE any
# tool can run. A dup'd descriptor keeps pointing at the original pipe no
# matter what a later ``dup2`` does to fd 1, so responses always reach the
# client. Guarded by a lock because it is a raw unbuffered fd: ``os.write`` is
# not atomic across interleaved callers, and a torn frame desyncs the stream
# for every subsequent message.
#
# NOTE: the suppressor also rebinds the ``sys.stdout`` OBJECT to a devnull
# file, so "has sys.stdout been swapped?" is NOT a usable liveness check -- it
# is false exactly inside the window we must survive. The snapshot is the only

    Tool calls run in a worker thread so the main read loop stays responsive to
    ``notifications/cancelled`` messages from the gateway. When a cancel is
    received for an in-flight request, the worker thread is interrupted via
    a threading.Event that cooperative tools (``wait``, ``spawn_sub_agents``)
    check periodically. The cancelled request emits no response (per MCP spec).

    ``tools/call`` requests that arrive while a worker is busy are buffered in
    a bounded FIFO queue and dispatched in order as the worker frees
    (silently dropping them left the client waiting forever on a response
    that never came). Queue overflow gets an immediate busy error response.

    On Windows ``select.select`` cannot poll ``sys.stdin`` (it only accepts
    sockets), so tool calls dispatch synchronously exactly as the pre-worker
    loop did — no in-flight cancel/ping interleave there (POSIX-only feature).

    (:func:`snapshot_stdout_fd`) so responses survive a library's process-wide
