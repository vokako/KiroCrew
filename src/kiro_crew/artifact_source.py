"""Copy-vs-link classification for promoting a file into the artifact library.

Promoting a file to an artifact has two defensible outcomes:

``copy``
    Snapshot the bytes into artifact storage and forget the path. Correct for
    *disposable* files — a download, a scratch file in the temp dir, something
    on the Desktop. The original can be deleted tomorrow without hollowing out
    the artifact.

``link``
    Record the path as a live pointer (:attr:`Artifact.source_path`) so the
    artifact and the file stay one document — editing either shows up in the
    other. Correct for files that live in a *real project*, where the file, not
    the artifact, is the thing under version control.

This module holds that decision and nothing else: :func:`classify_source` is a
pure function over a path plus a caller-supplied list of project roots, so the
ordering rules below are unit-testable without a store, a session, or a running
gateway.

Why the verdict carries a *root*
--------------------------------
A ``link`` verdict returns the directory that authorises later reads of the
file. :class:`~kiro_crew.artifacts.ArtifactStore` re-validates ``source_path``
containment on **every** read (a symlink swap after the fact must not escape),
and its default roots are the user's home dir plus the data home. A project at
``/workplace/user/repo`` is outside both, so a linked project file would be
refused on read — and the store would silently fall back to its stale snapshot.
Recording the authorising root on the artifact (``source_root``) is what makes
an out-of-home link actually work. It has to be recorded at create time because
the store has no session — and therefore no notion of "the current project" —
at read time.

#: it. ``is_sensitive_path`` still applies on top, and ``source_path`` must still
#: resolve inside the returned root.

    0. **Unusable input → copy.** Not a non-empty ``str``, not absolute after

       ``.git`` — see :data:`PROJECT_ROOT_MARKERS` for why every marker must live
       inside the directory it authorizes.
    3. **Otherwise → copy.** No project marker anywhere above it: treat the
