"""Full new-path dispatch: DiscordTransport -> TurnDriver -> DiscordRenderer.

``DiscordTransport.receive()`` authorizes + normalizes an inbound message and
hands the ``InboundMessage`` to :meth:`DiscordDispatcher.handle_message`,
which mirrors the Telegram transport dispatch:

    command intercept (!new, !compact, !help, …)
    -> construct DiscordRenderer + on_turn_start (typing indicator)
    -> session acquire -> context build
    -> TurnDriver.run(provider, renderer)   # shared redaction + approval ladder
    -> post-turn (record_success, persist, soft-threshold notice)  # each guarded
    -> renderer.close() + session release   # in finally

``on_interaction`` resolves interactive tool approvals (``a:<rid>:<1|0>`` ->
``DiscordApprovalDecider.resolve_global``) and re-injects ``[OPTIONS:]``
choices (``opt:<i>``) as fresh turns.

Dependency direction is ``discord -> messaging`` (allowed). The security
``tool_gate`` and spawn auto-approve are wired inline off ``ctx_builder.hooks``
(channel-neutral) so this module never imports ``kiro_crew.slack``.

        ``interpret_commands`` says whether *text* may execute as a command
        (model-authored text never may). Resume routing is consulted when
        ``interpret_commands`` is true OR the turn carries an ``origin_tag`` —
        the tag implies routing, because validating it requires resolving the
        binding to compare keys. The callers that dispatch with commands off
        and no tag DEPEND on the skip: a queue drain replays messages that were
        accepted for the native session while it was busy (a resumed session's
        busy turn refuses instead of queueing, so a drained item's affinity is
        native by construction), and an AutoNudge fire targets the native key
        its loop resolved and rotation-checked — routing either into a binding
        created later would run them in a session that never queued or armed
        them. An ``[OPTIONS:]`` press dispatches with commands off but a
        non-empty tag: the buttons were rendered on the bound session's own
        reply, so the choice belongs to that session even though its label must
        not execute as a command.

        ``origin_tag`` is the provenance stamp a pressed option button carried
        (see :func:`~kiro_crew.discord.renderer.session_provenance_tag`). When
        non-empty, the turn runs ONLY if the session it resolves to is the one
        that posted the buttons — checked before the busy path (so a stale press
        cannot be queued and replayed tag-less) and AGAIN after idle/daily
        rotation (so it cannot run under a generation the tag never named).
        Discord replays old components indefinitely, so without this check a
        button minted by one session would inject its model-authored choice into
        whatever session the conversation was later rebound to (`!unlink` +
        `!sessions`), or into a post-`!new` conversation that never asked the
        question. An option press ALWAYS supplies a tag: untagged
        (pre-provenance) presses are refused at the interaction boundary in
        :meth:`on_interaction`, never dispatched here.
