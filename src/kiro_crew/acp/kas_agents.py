"""Project a Crew agent spec onto KAS's ``ClientCustomAgent`` shape.

kiro-cli reads agent definitions from ``~/.kiro/agents/*.json`` and selects one
with a ``--agent`` flag. KAS has no such flag: it advertises only its own
built-in modes and takes client agents over the wire, as
``_meta.kiro.customAgents`` on ``session/new``. Each injected agent is
registered and then surfaces as a switchable mode, which is what lets the
ordinary ``session/set_mode`` activation work afterwards.

Two properties of KAS's schema drive the mapping and are easy to get wrong:

* ``prompt`` must be resolved content. A ``file://`` URI is the client's job to
  read, so a spec that points at a prompt file has to be inlined here.
* ``tools`` absent means NO tool access, not "all tools" — KAS resolves it as
  ``agent.tools ?? []``. The list is therefore always emitted explicitly, and an
  ambiguous spec fails closed rather than guessing ``*``.

``mcpServers`` IS projected, minus the names that arrive as session-level broker
stubs. ``@server`` entries in ``tools`` do resolve wherever the server was
declared, so carrying the servers twice would risk a double registration — but
that only arises for a STUBBED server, and stubs are opt-in per server
(``mcp_gateway.stub_servers``, empty by default). With nothing stubbed the
session-level param is an empty array, so omitting the block leaves a KAS session
holding ``tools: ["@kirocrew-core", ...]`` and no definition of what
``kirocrew-core`` is — refs naming nothing, and every Crew tool silently absent.
kiro-cli does not have this problem: it reads the spec off disk itself via
``--agent``.

Filtering by the stub set keeps the no-double-registration guarantee (a stubbed
server is still declared exactly once, by the injection that outranks this block)
while never leaving the session with nothing. Two fields are dropped on the way
through — see :func:`_project_mcp_servers`.

``model`` is deliberately NOT projected: the model is set through its own
protocol verb, so it has exactly one owner rather than being pinned in two places
that can disagree.

``permissions`` IS projected, and is the one field that changes behaviour rather
than just describing it. KAS's policy is keyed by its own capability vocabulary
instead of by tool name, so it is not a rename of Crew's ``allowedTools`` — see
:mod:`kiro_crew.acp.kas_permissions` for the mapping and for why an entry it
cannot classify is left to prompt. Omitting the field is not the neutral choice
it looks like: with no policy, KAS resolves every request to ``ask``, so a spec
that auto-approves a dozen tools on kiro-cli would prompt for all of them here.
It is derived from ``allowedTools`` and from nothing else: a ``permissions``
block already in the spec is NOT relayed, because ``allowedTools`` is the only
auto-approve input Crew's governance ceiling has filtered.

    Three subtractions, each load-bearing:

    * **stubbed names** — those arrive as the session-level ``mcpServers`` param,
      which outranks an agent-declared entry. Emitting both is the double
      registration this block exists to avoid.
    * **``autoApprove``** — an auto-approved MCP tool is approved by the host and
      emits no permission request, so ``hooks.on_tool_call`` (the always-on deny
      floor, the sensitive-path check, the governance ceiling) never runs for it.
      ``agent.py`` states the rule for Crew's own servers ("DELIBERATELY NO
      ``autoApprove`` KEY, and none may ever be added"); relaying one copied from
      a spec would grant through this path what that rule refuses on the other,
      and on KAS there is no wire slot for hooks at all. Auto-approve reaches KAS
      only as ``permissions``, derived from the ceiling-filtered ``allowedTools``.
    * **``env`` and ``headers``** — projection puts these on the wire, and a
      declared server's env routinely holds tokens. Every server is filtered; the
      classes differ only in what survives. A server Crew did not author loses
      both fields outright. One of Crew's OWN managed servers keeps exactly
      ``KIROCREW_HOME`` out of its env and nothing else, because that key is the
      only reason managed env is projected at all: without it the shims read a

      withheld like any other.

    A non-managed server therefore starts without its credentials and may fail to
    authenticate — which is still strictly better than today, where it does not
    start at all. The drop is logged with KEY NAMES ONLY so an operator can see
    why, without the value reaching a log.

    Note what this canNOT reach: ``command``, ``args`` and ``url`` are how the
    server is launched or addressed, so a secret embedded THERE (an ``--api-key``
    argv, a signed query string) still crosses the wire. Stripping them would not
    withhold a credential, it would unmake the server — the exact "declared but
