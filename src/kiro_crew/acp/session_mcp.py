"""Kiro agent spec -> the ACP ``session/new`` ``mcpServers`` array.

For a harness in :data:`~kiro_crew.acp_backends.ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_MCP_ARRAY`,
the ``session/new`` / ``session/load`` ``mcpServers`` parameter is where MCP
servers come from and the only place: claude-agent-acp, its one member today,
does not read ``~/.kiro/agents/<name>.json``. kiro-cli reaches the same servers
through ``--agent``, which is why that backend passes no array at all. Without
the translation here such a session runs with ZERO Kiro Crew tools -- the harness
itself works (prompts, streaming, permissions) but ``send_message``,
``spawn_run``, ``cron_add`` and every user-installed server are simply absent.

Nothing here is Anthropic-specific by design: the module is keyed on the
capability, not on the harness, so the next adapter that reads no agent spec
joins the set rather than growing a second translator.

The agent spec stays the single source of truth; there is no second,
claude-shaped registry to keep in sync. It is read per spawn, so installing or
toggling an MCP server takes effect on the NEXT session with no gateway restart.
Nothing here raises: a missing or malformed spec degrades to Crew's own control
plane, never to a failed spawn.

Shape notes -- these are claude-agent-acp's zod schema rather than anything in
the ACP spec at large:

* ``env`` (stdio) and ``headers`` (http/sse) are REQUIRED arrays of
  ``{"name", "value"}`` objects. Omitting either fails ``session/new`` outright
  with ``-32602 Invalid params (expected array, received undefined)``, so they
  are always emitted -- empty when there is nothing to carry.
* A url-bearing entry is routed by ``type``. Without one the adapter takes the
  stdio branch and rejects the entry for having no ``command``, so the transport
  is always spelled out.
* kiro-cli-only keys (``timeout``, ``disabledTools``, ``autoApprove``) cannot
  ride along in an element. ``disabledTools`` is a RESTRICTION, so dropping it
  outright would widen the tool surface; it comes back as a
  ``permissions.deny`` rule instead (see :func:`session_mcp_deny_rules`).
  ``autoApprove`` is dropped deliberately, not for want of a mapping:
  Claude's nearest equivalent is a ``permissions.allow`` entry, and a
  pre-approved tool is one Claude never asks about -- so the call never reaches
  the host ``canUseTool`` gate that carries the deny floor, the sensitive-path
  check and the governance ceiling. Every MCP call on this backend is gated.

**The governing rule, stated once because each corner of it is easy to argue
separately: this module matches kiro-cli, and deviating in EITHER direction
is the defect.** Granting what kiro-cli would drop widens the session's tool
surface behind the user's back; withholding what kiro-cli would keep removes
capability from a session with no error to explain it. Two consequences that are
otherwise easy to argue backwards:

* **Which specs are resolved.** kiro-cli resolves ``--agent`` against the project
  checkout's ``.kiro/agents/*.json`` as well as ``~/.kiro/agents/``, so this
  module must too, project-nearest first. Resolving only the user level looked
  conservative and was the opposite: a project-only agent found no spec, so its
  ``tools`` allowlist never ran and the control plane mounted unrestricted --
  a user-declared restriction dropped silently. See :func:`_agent_spec_for`.
* **What the registry ceiling governs.** Registry mode withholds every
  SPEC-DECLARED server, because nothing here can resolve a marker against the
  admin's catalog. It does NOT withhold Crew's own control plane, which is
  re-derived from the managed source rather than read from the spec. That is
  kiro-cli parity, not an exemption: ``agent._install_agent_spec`` stamps the
  managed servers with ``"type": "registry"`` precisely so the client keeps them
  under registry mode, and ``agent._mcp_registry_mode`` records their
  disappearance as the defect ("the features they carry (``spawn_run``,
  ``cron_add``, ``learn_add``, ...) disappear with no local error"). Withholding
  them HERE would make this backend stricter than kiro-cli and reproduce that
  failure on the installs least able to diagnose it. The control plane is still
  subject to the ``tools`` allowlist, which is the restriction that does apply.
