"""ACP client — JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio with `kiro-cli acp` or `claude-agent-acp`.

Protocol (ACP JSON-RPC 2.0):
  initialize → session/new → session/set_mode → session/set_model → session/prompt
  (claude backend: skips set_mode and uses session/set_config_option for model)

Agent selection: ``session/set_mode`` with ``modeId`` activates the agent
config (prompt, tools, resources).  MCP servers are passed explicitly
in ``session/new`` via the ``mcpServers`` parameter.

Permission flow:
  ← session/request_permission (server→client REQUEST with uuid id)
  → {result: {outcome: {outcome: "selected", optionId: "allow_once"}}}

# who sets it reaches the child through the ambient environment copy, so naming it
# here would imply a wiring that does not exist (its claude counterpart,
# CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE, IS explicitly forwarded — the asymmetry is deliberate).

# High-frequency, content-free adapter stderr diagnostics that _drain_stderr()
# drops instead of forwarding as per-line WARNINGs.  The driving case is the
# claude-agent-acp "Unexpected case: {...thinking_tokens...}" line.  Mechanism
# (confirmed by reading the vendored adapter, dist/acp-agent.js): the backend
# emits a `system` message with subtype `thinking_tokens`, but the adapter's
# `switch (message.subtype)` enumerates ~18 known subtypes (init, status,
# compact_boundary, memory_recall, api_retry, ...) and routes anything else to
# `default: unreachable(message)`, which does `logger.error("Unexpected case:
# " + JSON.stringify(message))` to stderr — one line per token delta.  Measured
# at ~10 lines/sec during active thinking (one line per 2-4 thinking tokens; the
# payload is only estimated_tokens/_delta/uuid/session_id — no response content,
# so dropping them loses nothing).
#
# This is a forward-compat gap in the adapter, NOT new behavior in a specific
# backend build: the `thinking_tokens` event is present in both 2.1.165.357
# and 2.1.168.358 (verified by string-matching both bundled `claude` binaries —
# identical occurrences), so it predates the .168 update that drew attention to
# it.  Exactly when it began appearing in our logs is unconfirmed.  The cleaner
# long-term fix is upstream (add a `thinking_tokens` case to the adapter / bump
# the vendored version); this filter is the version-agnostic stopgap that also
# absorbs the next unenumerated subtype's flood.
#
# Why drop rather than just downgrade the level:
#   1. Log hygiene — gateway.log uses a RotatingFileHandler(maxBytes=2MB,
#      backupCount=3) (see cli.py), so a sustained burst rolls genuine
#      diagnostics out of the retained 8MB window.
#   2. Event-loop load — the file handler is a plain *synchronous* handler and
#      _drain_stderr runs as a task on the gateway event loop, so each forwarded
#      line costs a synchronous file write + two regex redaction passes on the
#      same loop that streams responses.  Per-session the cost is small; it
#      compounds across concurrent thinking sessions.
# (This is a log-volume / event-loop-load reduction, NOT a fix for any
# turn-stall or "agent not responding" symptom — no such causal link was
# established.)
#
# Match on a stable substring (not the full JSON) so the filter survives field
# changes, and keep the tuple NARROW so a genuine error line is never silently
# swallowed.

    """Remap *env*'s ``HOME`` to the pod's own OAuth-grant tree, for a
    pod-spawned kiro-cli child ONLY. Mutates *env* in place and returns it.

    Gated on BOTH the pod marker (``KIROCREW_POD``, set by
    ``pod.runtime.build_pod_env`` for the whole pod gateway) and
    *pod_home_remap* (membership in ``ACP_BACKENDS_POD_HOME_REMAP`` --
    harness-parity H6/H7, never a bare backend-name comparison), so this touches
    nothing outside a pod and nothing for a harness whose credentials do not
    follow ``$HOME``. That set is deliberately NOT
    ``ACP_BACKENDS_INTERNAL_SANDBOX``: the two answer different questions --
    "does this harness carry its own OS sandbox?" versus "does relocating this
    harness's HOME move its credential store?" -- so reusing the sandbox set
    would hand a harness added there for sandbox reasons credential-relocation
    semantics it never opted into.

    The marker is compared EXACTLY to ``"1"`` rather than tested for
    truthiness. Every non-empty string is truthy in Python, so an inherited
    ``KIROCREW_POD=false`` or ``KIROCREW_POD=0`` would otherwise remap ``HOME``
    for a child that is not in a pod at all -- the inverse of what the value
    says.

    kiro-cli derives its MCP OAuth artifact directory
    (``mcp_grant.kiro_oauth_cache_dir()``) from the SPAWNED PROCESS's real
    ``$HOME`` -- there is no env var that
    relocates just that one subtree (see ``config.paths.kiro_oauth_cache_home``
    for why ``KIRO_HOME`` does not help either) -- so the only way to make
    kiro-cli's OWN writes land in the pod's tree is to remap the child's
    ``HOME`` at spawn time. ``KIROCREW_OS_HOME`` names the SAME directory
    ``config.paths.kiro_oauth_cache_home()`` resolves for the pod's ``mcp_grant``
    reads, which is what keeps kiro-cli's writer and every ``mcp_grant`` reader
    looking at one tree instead of two independent derivations of "where do
    grants live" (see ``mcp_grant.kiro_oauth_cache_dir``'s docstring for the
    split this closes).

    A remap absent ``KIROCREW_OS_HOME`` (the marker set with no pod-scoped
    directory to point at -- a malformed pod env, or a caller that set the
    marker without the directory) leaves ``env`` untouched: an unset ``HOME``
    on a spawned child would break far more than OAuth grants, so the fail
    mode here is "kiro-cli reads the real host home", the status quo, not a
    broken spawn.

    Three obligations come with moving ``HOME``, each closed here:

    * kiro-cli's own sign-in must keep working. ``pod.runtime._seed_pod_os_home``
      mirrors the AGENT RUNTIME's identity store (``~/.local/share/kiro-cli`` and
      its per-platform siblings, derived from ``identity_stores``) into this tree
      at pod boot, which is where the harness actually resolves its access token.
      The host's ``.aws/sso/cache`` is NOT copied: that staging existed in an
      earlier revision and was deleted, so a pod's ``.aws/sso/cache`` starts empty
      and holds only grants the pod itself mints.
    * ``USERPROFILE`` moves WITH ``HOME`` (Windows spelling of the same
      concept) so a Windows pod does not read one remapped path and the other
      unremapped.
    * **AWS file-based credentials deliberately do NOT follow the child into the
      pod.** ``AWS_CONFIG_FILE`` / ``AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`` default to
      ``$HOME/.aws/{config,credentials}`` when unset, so a remapped ``HOME``
      sends the credential chain at the pod's own tree. An earlier revision
      pinned both variables back to the REAL home so a pod agent turn could
      still reach the operator's profiles. That pin is REMOVED, because naming
      those files in the child environment is itself the leak: ``security.py``
      matches command TEXT and performs no variable expansion, so the exported
      name is a working alias for a path the sensitive-path fence refuses by
      name -- and the alias is retrievable through an unbounded set of
      spellings (``$VAR``, ``${VAR}``, ``%VAR%``, ``$env:VAR``,
      ``os.environ['VAR']``, ``$(printenv VAR)``, ``eval``, indirect expansion,
      a helper script). Three review rounds each closed one spelling; a text
      matcher cannot close the class. Deleting the export deletes the alias,
      which is the only fix that does not depend on out-matching command
      substitution.

      What this costs, stated rather than implied: **an ACP agent turn inside a
      pod has no inherited AWS credentials on any path.** Both legs are closed,
      and an earlier revision of this comment got the second one wrong:

      * FILE credentials: removing the exports means ``~/.aws/{config,credentials}``
        resolves under the remapped (empty) pod home, so a profile that lives only
        in a file -- including a ``credential_process`` profile -- does not resolve.
      * ENVIRONMENT credentials: ``sandbox.scrub_agent_subprocess_env`` scrubs
        ``_SENSITIVE_ENV_PREFIXES``, which includes ``AWS_SECRET`` and
        ``AWS_SESSION``, from every Kiro/ACP child. So ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``
        and ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`` never reach the agent turn even when the
        operator has them. ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` survives (no ``AWS_ACCESS``
        prefix), but a key id without its secret is not a credential.

      This comment previously claimed "env-credentialed turns are unaffected",
      pointing at ``build_pod_env`` keeping ``AWS_*``. That keep is real but it is
      not the last word: ``build_pod_env`` shapes the pod GATEWAY's environment,
      and the ACP child is scrubbed AFTER it, so the two statements are about
      different processes. The corrected posture is strictly stronger than the one
      claimed, and it is the intended one for a throwaway instance whose whole
      purpose is to not hold machine-level credentials.

      An operator who needs AWS from inside a pod therefore cannot get it by
      exporting credentials into their shell; that is a deliberate property of the
      agent-subprocess scrub, not something this function can or should undo.

      An operator who sets either pointer variable in their OWN environment has it
      REMOVED here too, which is the half a later round corrected: whose file the
      variable names does not change what the pod's agent obtains by dereferencing
      it, and an absolute host pointer walks around the ``HOME`` relocation
      entirely. ``CREDENTIAL_POINTER_ENV_VARS`` carries the whole family, so the
      scrub below covers an inherited pointer and a manufactured one alike.

    Returns ``(argv, delegate_internal_sandbox)``. The second element is what
    callers pass as ``wrap_argv``'s ``is_kiro_cli``, so the binary choice and the
    sandbox-ownership choice cannot drift apart -- they are one decision with one
    cause, made here once for both ACP transports rather than restated in each.

    **Outside a pod this is a no-op by construction**: *argv* is returned
    unchanged and ``delegate_internal_sandbox`` is plain membership in
    ``ACP_BACKENDS_INTERNAL_SANDBOX``, byte-identical to what both call sites
    computed inline before. The exception is stated POSITIVELY (pod condition
    true) and gated on exactly the conditions that make
    :func:`_apply_pod_home_remap` fire -- the pod marker compared exactly to
    ``"1"``, membership in ``ACP_BACKENDS_POD_HOME_REMAP``, and a
    ``KIROCREW_OS_HOME`` to point at -- never on a backend negation, so a harness
    added to a set for some other reason cannot inherit this behaviour by
    accident (harness-parity H6/H7).

    **Why a pod child must not run the shim.** The remap gives the child a
    pod-owned ``HOME`` so kiro-cli's OAuth grants die with the pod. The installed
    ``kiro-cli`` is a shim that prefers ``aim sandbox``, and toolbox's sandbox
    builds its mount plan around the REAL user home: under a remapped ``HOME`` it
    fails to construct at all, exiting before kiro-cli starts (observed as
    ``Failed to spawn child process: Device or resource busy (os error 16)``, and
    inside a pod as ``toolbox: Unable to run aim: Command "aim" doesn't appear to
    be associated with any tool`` followed by a broken ACP pipe). Staging state
    into the pod home does not help -- an empty os-home, one carrying a
    ``.toolbox`` symlink, and one carrying a real ``.toolbox`` skeleton all fail
    identically -- because the obstacle is toolbox's mount plan, not a file the
    child cannot find. The bundle binary the shim itself falls back to has no
    such dependency: under the same remapped ``HOME`` it starts and reaches its
    normal "not logged in" state, which is precisely the state
    ``pod.runtime._seed_pod_os_home``'s staged SSO token answers.

    **So Kiro Crew's own sandbox takes over for that child.** Skipping the
    seatbelt/delegation is only sound while kiro-cli's internal sandbox actually
    runs; bypassing the shim means it does not, so ``delegate_internal_sandbox``
    goes ``False`` and ``wrap_argv`` wraps the child in Crew's launcher instead.
    The substitution is per-pod-child and never reaches a host session.

    If the bundle binary cannot be located the pair degrades to the status quo
    (shim, internal sandbox) rather than spawning something unlaunchable; a pod
    whose child cannot bootstrap is meant to be refused loudly at ``pod up``, not
    papered over here.

    predicate rather than a copy per call site — the same reason #1550 made the

    **Call this from an executor, never inline on the event loop.** On Windows it
    reads the config file (through ``apply_windows_resource_ceiling``) and walks
    two Toolhelp snapshots — the process table for the ownership check and the
    system-wide THREAD table to resume — so a slow config store or a loaded
    machine would otherwise stall every other session on that loop. Both ACP
    spawn sites wrap it in ``run_in_executor(subprocess_executor(), ...)``. It
    stays synchronous rather than becoming a coroutine because every step is
    blocking ctypes work with no await point to offer.

    Both ACP spawn sites (:meth:`AcpClient._spawn` and ``AcpRuntime._spawn``)
    create the session host with ``creationflags |=
    platform_compat.CREATE_SUSPENDED`` and call this immediately afterwards. On
    POSIX every step is a no-op — ``CREATE_SUSPENDED`` is 0 there, so the child
    was never suspended — which keeps one code path for both platforms.

    Why suspended: ``cgroup_scope_argv`` is a no-op on Windows (no systemd), so
    without this the agent and every MCP server it spawns would run with NO
    fork-bomb and NO memory-DoS ceiling. A Job object cannot be an argv prefix,
    so it must be attached to a live pid — and job membership covers a member's
    FUTURE descendants only. Attaching to an already-running kiro-cli would
    therefore leave a window in which it could spawn an MCP server that escapes
    the ceiling. ``CREATE_SUSPENDED`` closes that window by construction: the
    child has not executed a single instruction, so it provably has no
    descendants. Assign the job, then resume.

    A resume failure is FATAL, but only when the child is actually there: a
    process that exists yet cannot be resumed is alive-but-frozen, and letting it
    masquerade as a running agent would hang the session on the ACP handshake
    with no diagnosis. Kill it and raise instead. If the pid is already gone
    there is nothing frozen to worry about — it exited on its own — so note it
    and let the handshake surface the real error.

    The ceiling itself fails SOFT (``apply_windows_resource_ceiling`` logs a
    SECURITY warning and returns False): a missing ceiling must not break the
    gateway. Only the resume may abort the spawn, which is why it runs from a
    ``finally`` — a raising ceiling must still leave the child resumed or killed,
    never frozen.

    The two DESTRUCTIVE steps are gated on confirmed ownership: the pid's parent
    must be this process. A Job object would impose a process and memory ceiling
    on a stranger, and the unresumable branch KILLS what it is holding, so
    neither may ever act on a pid we did not create. The resume itself is NOT
    gated, because ``ResumeThread`` on a thread that is not suspended is a
    documented no-op (its suspend count is already 0) — and leaving our own child
    frozen would hang the session forever on the handshake with no diagnosis.
    That asymmetry is deliberate: an unconfirmed pid loses only its ceiling,
    which already fails soft by contract, while nothing can wedge or die by
    mistake.

        **In-memory, and deliberately so.** The translation reads disk, but it
        runs once per spawn in :meth:`_resolve_session_mcp_servers` and lands in
        ``_session_mcp_cache``; this accessor only hands the cached list out. That

        branch here (harness-parity H6). The set check comes FIRST, so a harness
        outside it returns before the cache is ever consulted and can never be
        made to read a spec.

        A cold cache resolves inline rather than returning nothing: a set member
        whose spawn path does not pre-warm would otherwise come up with zero
        tools, which is the exact defect this module exists to fix. That costs a
        brief blocking read on the loop, which is why the spawn path warms it.

        Per-spawn freshness is preserved: ``_reset_state`` clears the cache, so an

        author rediscovers. See ``docs/request-for-change/rfc-agent-config-mirror.md``.

        The highest-precedence project settings source the claude-agent-acp
        adapter reads, and the only channel for the things Crew has to control:

        1. ``permissions.defaultMode`` (``self._permission_mode``). The adapter
           short-circuits its ``canUseTool`` callback ONLY for
           ``bypassPermissions``; every other mode keeps forwarding tool
           decisions to the host as ``session/request_permission``, which is what
           puts a claude session under the same gate kiro-cli sessions run under.
           Omitted when no mode was requested, leaving the adapter's own default
           (ask) rather than asserting one.
        2. ``permissions.deny``, from
           :func:`~kiro_crew.acp.session_mcp.session_mcp_deny_rules`: the agent
           spec's ``disabledTools`` cannot ride along in the ``mcpServers`` array,
           and silently dropping a restriction while forwarding the server it
           narrows would widen the tool surface.
        3. ``availableModels`` plus the resolved ``model``, and ONLY once the
           backend has actually advertised a list. The adapter merges
           ``availableModels`` union+dedup across every settings source, so a user
           ``~/.claude`` carrying ``['opus','sonnet']`` is enough to collapse a
           versioned ``[1m]`` id (1M-token window) back to 200K -- and a
           registry-derived list seeded here does exactly the same thing to any
           model the registry has not caught up on. So on a cold advertised-model
           cache both keys are omitted (the adapter's own provider list is
           already right) and the re-seed after this session's capture fills them
           in. See :func:`~kiro_crew.model_registry.seed_available_models`.

        **Crew touches only the file it owns.** Ownership is not the path -- a
        path under a checked-out repository is not Crew's to claim -- it is having
        CREATED the file (``_claude_settings_authored``, or the durable record in
        :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.seed_provenance` for a seed an earlier session left
        behind) AND the bytes on disk still being the ones Crew wrote. Both hold:
        overwrite by STAGE AND RENAME, which is what lets the model-substitution
        re-seed change the resolved model instead of re-sending byte-identical
        params and taking the same advisory again, without a partial write ever
        being observable at the path. Either fails: leave the path entirely alone.
        Absent: create with ``O_EXCL``, so a sibling session racing the same
        ``work_dir`` loses the create rather than clobbering the winner.

        The durable half is what makes the ownership test survive the process. A
        session killed before ``_reset_state`` leaves its seed on disk, and with a
        session-scoped test only, every later session read that orphan as a
        stranger's file and refused to touch it -- so the stale allowlist, stale
        ``model`` and stale ``permissions.defaultMode`` became permanent, and no
        amount of re-running Crew could repair them. Recognizing the orphan by
        digest lets it be re-seeded (or removed on reset) while a genuinely
        user-authored file is still left exactly as it was.

        That is what keeps this seam out of a user's project state: nothing here
        reads, merges into, rewrites or deletes a file Crew did not author, so
        there is no snapshot to take, no ownership to arbitrate between two
        sessions sharing a ``work_dir``, and no restore write on the teardown
        path.

        The cost is stated rather than hidden: a project that already carries its
        own ``settings.local.json`` gets NO seed, so that session runs without the
        ``availableModels`` allowlist and without the ``permissions.deny`` rules
        derived from ``disabledTools``, and an inherited ``bypassPermissions``
        there is not stripped. Those tool calls still reach the host gate unless
        the user's own file pre-approves them, which is the same disclosed
        boundary the inherited-``~/.claude`` gap already documents. Preserving
        such a file and restoring it afterwards is tracked separately; doing it
        here means reading and rewriting a path a checked-out repository controls.

        Blocking (writes a file); callers run it off the loop.

        The model here was NOT chosen for this turn: it arrives from the agent
        spec, the config default, or a slot value persisted before the account's
        entitlements were known. So when the backend has already told us the

        Before this step existed the seed was written once, before capture, and

          and re-injected into ``self._buffer`` IN ORDER once the matching
          response arrives or on timeout.

        Server requests and foreign responses must NOT be re-appended to
        ``self._buffer`` mid-loop and ``continue``-d: ``_read_message`` pops

        preserving the frame so a later ``_prompt_loop`` / ``_process_message``
        can answer the deferred ``session/request_permission`` request.

        The deadline is **activity-based**: any received message (notification,
        deferred frame, or the matching response) resets it to ``now + timeout``,
        bounded by an absolute ``_WAIT_RESPONSE_MAX_TIMEOUT`` safety cap. This
        keeps a long ``session/load`` replay (which streams the entire prior
        transcript as ``session/update`` notifications before resolving) alive

        The oracle walks ``/proc`` for the backend subprocess subtree — a
        synchronous filesystem walk that can block on a wedged fd — so it runs
        on ``subprocess_executor()`` under a bounded timeout, the same treatment
        the runtime's other /proc probes get. Any failure or timeout degrades to
        a non-WORKING verdict so the caller falls through to ending the turn
        (fail toward reaping, never toward hanging).

        Scope, mirroring the shared-runtime oracle this converges onto:
        - Linux-only evidence. On a host without ``/proc`` the verdict is
          UNKNOWN → the turn is reaped at the cutoff exactly as before this
          gate existed, so the change is behavior-preserving off Linux and a
          strict improvement on the gateway's Linux deploy target.
        - Subtree-aggregate movement. A busy *unrelated* descendant (e.g. an
          MCP child polling) can read WORKING even if the model turn itself is
          wedged with a lost completion frame, extending that turn to the
          ``_DEFAULT_PROMPT_TIMEOUT`` backstop rather than reaping at 90s. This
          is an inherent property of the shared ``LivenessOracle`` (the kiro
          path has it too); tighter per-branch attribution belongs in
          ``liveness.py``, shared by both callers, not here.

        A timed-out await does not stop its executor thread. The one-outstanding-
        walk bound, the refused-submission-reads-UNKNOWN contract, and exception
        retrieval all live in the shared :func:`consult_offloaded` guard.
        ``_prompt_loop`` retires the tracked future at turn start under
        ``_turn_lock``, so a walk abandoned by one turn never gates the next (at
        the cost of one abandoned worker per turn, versus one per silent read
        before this guard existed).

        (a pending executor future never raises on its own) — the timeout raises
        ``TimeoutError`` (an ``Exception`` subclass), which the handler below
        swallows so dispatch always proceeds. Per the fault-isolation guideline a
        leaked worker thread is survivable; a stalled dispatch is not.
        ``tool_name``/``tool_kind`` use the same ``or`` fallbacks as the

          1. A `content` array carrying the tool output as text blocks — arrives

        ``_handle_compaction_status``: it applies the same state mutations
        (arm/disarm the post-failure budget, drop the stale context counts) and

        Callers MUST still forward the text. The event is a SIDE EFFECT, never

        assistant text with no marker of any kind, so recognizing one is a guess

        guess into deleted model output. A caller that yields structured events
        marks the forwarded chunk ``control_notice`` instead, so a consumer can
        show the text without counting it as the turn's own answer.
