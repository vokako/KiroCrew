"""Build ACP ``session/prompt`` content blocks from a plain message string.

Channels hand the provider ONE string. When that string contains an absolute
path to a readable image, the image must travel as a real ACP image block --
a bare path is just text, and the model cannot see it. This module owns that
conversion so both prompt paths share one implementation:

* :meth:`kiro_crew.acp.session_handle.AcpSessionHandle.prompt` -- the live path
  for the public Kiro backend (``AcpProvider.start`` swaps ``AcpClient`` out for
  ``AcpSessionProvider``, so this is what actually reaches kiro-cli).
* :meth:`kiro_crew.acp.client.AcpClient._send_prompt` -- the direct-client path.

Keeping one builder matters: both paths need the same path-to-image
conversion, so a single implementation stops any channel from shipping a
filesystem path to the model as text.

Wire shape (per docs/reference/kiro-cli/acp.md):

#    two paths, so "/tmp/a.png and /tmp/b.png" matched as ONE span ending at the
#    final ".png" -- not a file, so every image in a multi-image message was
#    dropped.
#
# 2. The character class holds HORIZONTAL whitespace only, and a lookbehind
#    forbids starting inside a URL or another path. With `\s` (which includes
#    "\n") a leading URL chained across the newline into the appended path:
#    `slack/events.py` emits "<user text>\n<image path>", so
#
#        see https://example.com/docs\n/tmp/a.png
#
#    matched as "//example.com/docs\n/tmp/a.png" -- one nonexistent path. Any
#    Slack message containing a link therefore lost its image. The `(?<![\w:/])`
#    guard rejects the "/" inside "https://" as a start position, which also
#    stops a URL that merely ends in ".png" from being probed as a local file.

    * ``type_counts`` -- a count per block ``type`` (``text`` / ``image`` /
      ``tool_use`` / ``tool_result`` / ``other`` for any unrecognised or
      typeless shape).
    * ``empty_text_blocks`` -- text blocks whose ``text`` is missing, blank, or
      whitespace-only (a structurally suspicious payload). A text block with no
      ``text`` key at all is as suspect as one whose ``text`` is a blank
      string, so both fold into this count.
    * ``tool_use`` / ``tool_result`` -- the two tool-block counts surfaced at
      the top level so a pairing imbalance (a ``tool_result`` with no matching
      ``tool_use``, or vice versa) is visible at a glance.
    * ``total_bytes`` -- length of ``json.dumps`` of the NORMALISED block list
      (``[]`` when the argument is not a list or tuple), the approximate
      serialized wire size of the outbound request. Measuring the normalised
      list keeps the size coherent with the counts: a non-list argument reports
      ``block_count: 0`` alongside ``total_bytes: 2`` (an empty ``[]``) rather
      than a size describing a payload the counts claim is empty.

    This summary is deliberately safe to log: it carries no content and
    therefore cannot leak credentials or user data. That is a hard
    requirement -- the kiro-cli data dir is fenced precisely because it holds
    SSO tokens, so the outbound-request diagnostics must expose counts, types,
    and sizes ONLY, never the bytes themselves.

    Defensive by contract: this is a diagnostics helper on the live prompt
    path, so it never raises. A malformed ``blocks`` argument (not a list,
    ``None`` entries, non-dict entries, unserialisable content) yields a
    partial/minimal summary instead of propagating an exception into the turn.
