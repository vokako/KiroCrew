"""Per-session liveness oracle — wellness is the detector, timeouts are the backstop.

A timeout is a poor death detector: a stale-turn window (90s) or a tool-stall
window (600s) kills healthy-but-slow work — a silent 30-minute redirected
build, a ``wait(1800)`` poll, or a long non-streamed reasoning stretch. This
module inverts that shape: an EFFECTIVE per-session oracle returns a verdict
with evidence, so the watchdog in ``session_handle.py`` acts FASTER on real
deaths and never on healthy work.

    verdict = oracle(session) -> WORKING | DEAD | STUCK_INPUT | UNKNOWN

Policy (enforced by the caller in ``session_handle._dispatch_events``):

- ``WORKING``     -> never act (log once per interval at most).
- ``DEAD``        -> act immediately: recovery lands seconds after actual death
                     instead of at a blanket 90s/600s timeout.
- ``STUCK_INPUT`` -> act immediately, with a cause the recovery nudge can name
                     ("re-run non-interactively").
- ``UNKNOWN``     -> the only timeout-governed class, with non-lethal actions.

Evidence sources (Linux ``/proc`` first-class, a ``libproc`` backend on
macOS, no new dependencies):

- **Shell tool in flight**: scan the runtime's descendant tree for a non-zombie
  child whose cmdline matches the session's cached command. A live match is
  definite WORKING (a 40-minute build runs untouched). Once matched, the pid is
  tracked so exit detection is exact: a tracked child that exits without a tool
  result frame flips to DEAD after a short grace. A matched-but-frozen subtree
  blocked reading a tty/stdin is STUCK_INPUT. When nothing matches, the two
  reasons are kept apart: an OBSERVABLE tree in which no live descendant is
  young enough to have been started by this dispatch carries the
  :data:`EVIDENCE_SHELL_CHILD_ABSENT` tag (the command is not running — the
  caller narrows the UNKNOWN window), while a tree that does hold such a
  descendant, or one whose child list cannot be read at all, keeps the plain
  evidence and the full window: the match heuristic may simply have failed to
  recognize live work.
- **MCP ``wait`` tool**: declared-duration contract — WORKING until the parsed
  ``seconds`` (+ slack) elapse, then UNKNOWN.
- **Other MCP tools**: sample the descendant tree's CPU/IO movement across
  successive checks; moving -> WORKING, flat -> UNKNOWN.
- **Model-wait (no tool in flight)**: sample the tree's IO/CPU counters across
  checks (token/keepalive receipt moves them) and its established TCP sockets.
  Flat counters with NO established backend socket is the done-but-lost-frame
  wedge signature -> DEAD. Established-but-flat is UNKNOWN with the
  :data:`EVIDENCE_ESTABLISHED_FLAT` tag so the caller can extend the probe
  window for probably-thinking (non-streamed reasoning) turns.

On macOS there is no procfs, so the tree is read in-process through ``libproc``
(:class:`LibprocBackend`, selected once per oracle when the platform is darwin
and ``proc_root`` does not exist): ``proc_listchildpids`` enumerates the
runtime's descendants, ``PROC_PIDTBSDINFO`` dates each one and tells a zombie
apart, ``KERN_PROCARGS2`` (falling back to ``proc_pidpath``) supplies the
cmdline the SAME matching rules run against, and ``PROC_PIDTASKINFO`` sums the
subtree's CPU time. That gives macOS the shell-child match / exit detection /
absence narrowing and the MCP-subtree movement probe, with movement being
CPU-only (the evidence string says so — there is no per-process IO counter to
read). What has no libproc equivalent stays exactly as absent: no socket
evidence (so a flat model wait is UNKNOWN, never DEAD, and never tagged
``established_flat``), no wchan / blocked-fd evidence (so STUCK_INPUT is never
claimed). The backend is injectable (``darwin_backend`` ctor arg), and the
Linux path is untouched by its presence.

Every probe is wrapped: any error degrades the verdict to UNKNOWN — never to a
kill. Each check is cheap (<10ms of file reads); two-sample deltas are computed
across successive calls (the dispatch loop's queue-timeout ticks) rather than
sleeping inline, gated on ``sample_min_secs`` between samples.

Attribution on a shared runtime: each handle probes only ITS OWN runtime pid,
and the cmdline match keys shell evidence to THIS session's in-flight command.
Where attribution is impossible the verdict degrades to UNKNOWN.

Unit-testable against a fake ``/proc`` tree via the ``proc_root`` ctor arg and
an injectable ``now`` clock.

# suspect window on a command that already exited — the sub-second shell tool
# whose result frame was lost is never observed alive, so the plain
# "no matching shell child" evidence must not buy it the full forbearance.
#
# Deliberately NOT a DEAD verdict: absence is inferred from process start times,
# and a live command that exec'd into something the cmdline heuristic misses is

# Tool names that are known to wrap a model call (e.g. kiro-cli's use_subagent

# ``tool_name`` (from ``_meta.kiro.toolName``) is in this set. Without
# positive attribution the socket may be a persistent keepalive for an
# unrelated backend connection (e.g. model-service keep-alive) while an
# ordinary quiet MCP tool is running — narrowing the build-scale suspect window to 15
# minutes in that case would incorrectly penalise long-running ordinary tools.
#
# COUPLING: these are kiro-cli TOOL NAMES, matched verbatim against the ACP
# tool-call frame. If kiro-cli renames use_subagent or ships another
# model-wrapping tool, narrowing silently stops applying and those stalls
# fall back to the build-scale window (fail-safe direction: too patient,
# never a surprise cancel — but the fast-detection this list exists for is
# lost). No handshake advertises the model-wrapping property today, so a

        instead (a boot-clock age subtracted from a monotonic stamp) placed a
        live child a full suspend EARLIER than it started, so a laptop resumed
        mid-command read as "this child predates its own dispatch".

        The window opens by ``dispatch_parked_secs`` as well, because the stamp
        marks when the tool_call frame was PROCESSED, not when the runtime
        spawned: a frame queued behind a consumer-side await (an approval, an IM
        send, a hook) is stamped that much late, and its child then looks older
        than its own dispatch. The dispatch loop already measures exactly that
        park, so the bound is measured rather than guessed.

        Fail-open by design: a missing stamp or an undatable process (no tick
        rate on Linux, no readable start elsewhere) answers True, so an
        unattributable process reads as possibly-this-tool's. That keeps a live
        command matched and keeps an absence claim from resting on evidence the
        oracle does not have.

        the runtime's fork dates a live child BEFORE its dispatch; a command the
        matchers cannot recognise (fully redacted input) then has nothing to veto
        the absence claim, and the caller narrows to the stale window and cancels

    bounded ``wait_for``. This helper owns the full non-obvious sequence both
    watchdog paths depend on, so a fix to it lands at both call sites at once:

    - **One outstanding walk per holder.** A timed-out await does not stop its
      executor thread, so the submitted future is tracked on the holder and any
      poll that finds it unfinished answers UNKNOWN without submitting again —
      otherwise a permanently wedged /proc read grows a new blocked worker per
      tick and starves the shared pool teardown also draws from. The holder's
      liveness-state boundary retires the handle so a walk abandoned by one
      generation never gates the next.
    - **Submission stays inside the guard.** The callers are silent-read polls
      and watchdog ticks, so a refused executor job (shut down during teardown,
      thread creation refused under load) must read as UNKNOWN rather than
      abort the live turn.
    - **Exception retrieval rides a callback attached at SUBMISSION**, not only
      an ``except`` arm: a turn that ends on this verdict returns with the walk
      still running and may never look again, and ``CancelledError`` is a
      ``BaseException`` an ``except Exception`` arm would miss. ``wait_for``
      cancels the shield's outer future and shield detaches its inner-done
      callback in exactly that case, so the pre-submission consume below
      additionally covers an already-completed prior that never went through
      the callback. Retrieval is not destructive — the await still sees the
      result.
    - **Any failure degrades to UNKNOWN**, never to a raise: the callers fail
      toward their own timeout policy (reaping at the cutoff), never toward
      hanging or killing on a probe error.

    ``executor_factory`` is passed by the caller (not resolved here) so each
