"""Durable provenance for the ``settings.local.json`` seed Crew writes.

Crew seeds ``<work_dir>/.claude/settings.local.json`` for a claude-agent-acp
session and overwrites or removes ONLY the file it owns. Proving that ownership
from per-instance memory alone ("this client created it" plus "the bytes it
wrote") answers the question correctly inside one session and wrongly outside
one: a seed left behind by a session that was killed, or by an earlier app
version, reads as a stranger's file forever after. The writer then
takes its leave-it-alone branch on every subsequent session, so a stale
``availableModels`` allowlist (and a stale ``permissions.defaultMode``, up to an
inherited ``bypassPermissions``) becomes permanent project state that Crew can
neither refresh nor clean up.

This module is the missing half: a small record, under Crew's OWN data home, of
the bytes Crew last wrote to a given settings path. It is a **provenance
credential, not a permission grant** — a record alone proves nothing, because
adoption additionally requires the file on disk to still hash to the recorded
digest. A user-authored file (or a Crew file the user has since edited) never
matches, so it is still left untouched; only Crew's own orphan is recognized and
re-seeded.

Four properties the callers depend on:

* **Nothing is added to the user's project.** The record lives beside Crew's
  other sidecars in ``config_dir()``, keyed by the settings path, so a checked-out
  repository gains no extra file to notice, ignore or commit.
* **Lookups never touch the disk, and no mutation runs on the event loop.**
  Ownership is consulted synchronously from teardown, so the sidecar is read once
  at import and served from memory afterwards. Both MUTATIONS (:func:`record` and
  :func:`forget`) write and are therefore blocking; each has an off-loop caller,
  and :func:`forget` is awaited through a thread rather than called from the loop.
  :func:`release` is the in-memory-only counterpart that teardown may call
  directly.
* **Every failure answers "not ours".** An unreadable or corrupt sidecar, a
  missing entry, a malformed entry — all degrade to the pre-existing behaviour of
  leaving the file alone, which is the safe direction.
* **A record is adoptable only once nobody here still holds it.** Ownership is
  scoped to an owner token, so an orphan is adopted by the next session while a
  path a LIVE client in this process is seeding stays that client's own.

    failure instead of only logging it.

    **Reload-merge-publish under the cross-process lock.** The sidecar is shared by
    every Crew process on the host, and ``atomic_write`` renaming a new inode over it
    makes the LAST writer win outright. So this reloads the on-disk seeds INSIDE
    :func:`_cross_process_lock`, overlays this process's own ``_RECORDS``, and
    publishes the union — a concurrent process's records are preserved rather than
    dropped. This process's entries win for any key it holds; keys present only on
    disk belong to another live process and are kept untouched. Reloading a sibling's
    key into what is published does NOT make this process treat it as adoptable: only
    ``_RECORDS`` (never refreshed from disk here) feeds :func:`recorded`, so a live
    sibling's seed still reads as absent — "not ours" — to this process.

    *drop* removes the key a :func:`forget` just revoked. Without it the merge would
    resurrect that key from the copy still on disk, and the revoke would never stick.

    There is exactly ONE prune, and it runs unconditionally: entries whose file is
    gone. Nothing is left at those paths to overwrite, adopt or clean up, so they are
    pure growth. *keep* exempts the key the current transaction just wrote, so the
    entry a :func:`record` has this moment created is authoritative even if the caller
    has not put a file there. Without it a record would depend on a stat of a path the
    module does not own the writing of, and "record then look it up" -- the one
    invariant every caller leans on -- would answer differently depending on how the
    caller sequenced its own write.

    There is deliberately no entry CAP on top of that. A cap can only evict entries
    whose file still exists, and those are precisely the adoptable orphans this module
    exists to keep: evicting one makes its path unrecorded, so its own owner can no
    longer recognize it and no later session is permitted to repair it either —
    whatever the file holds (a stale ``availableModels``, a stale
    ``permissions.defaultMode``, up to an inherited ``bypassPermissions``) becomes
    permanent project state. That is the exact failure this module removes, so a cap
    would re-manufacture it for the oldest work dir. Growth is already bounded by the
    prune above: the sidecar cannot outgrow the set of seeds actually on disk.

    Callers hold :data:`_LOCK`, which serializes this process's threads; the
    cross-process lock serializes other processes; the reload, merge, prune, snapshot
    and publish are one transaction across both.
