"""How Kiro Crew reaches KAS: kiro-cli's own ACP relay, not a private spawn.

kiro-cli exposes the KAS (Kiro Agent Server) engine through its ``acp``
subcommand -- ``--agent-engine v3`` selects it, and ``--auth-method cli`` makes
the relay resolve access tokens from kiro-cli's own credential store. The relay
forwards ACP frames to KAS in both directions, so Kiro Crew speaks ordinary ACP
to a kiro-cli process and never touches KAS's bundle, its Node runtime, or its
tokens.

Crew does NOT locate kiro-cli's *extracted* KAS bundle itself and run
``node .../acp-server.js --auth=acp-callback``. That works, but it makes Crew
depend on kiro-cli's internal on-disk layout (a
``{data_dir}/kas/{version}-{hash}/node_modules/@kiro/agent/...`` path that
kiro-cli is free to change) and it puts Crew in the credential path: KAS asks
Crew for a token over ``_kiro/auth/getAccessToken`` and Crew shells out to a
hidden ``kiro-cli chat _ get-kas-token`` verb to answer. The relay owns both
concerns, so neither belongs here.

Frame parity between the two routes is measured, not assumed:
all forward methods Crew sends (``initialize``, ``session/new`` carrying
``_meta.kiro.customAgents``, ``session/set_mode``, ``session/prompt``,
``session/cancel``, ``session/load``, ``_kiro/session/delete``) behave
identically, and every reverse frame Crew consumes arrives unchanged --
``session/update`` (including the ``_meta.kiro`` display kinds
:mod:`kiro_crew.acp.kas_wire` matches on), ``session/request_permission``
round-trips, and the connection-level notifications. The relay additionally
advertises two extension methods the direct route does not, so its surface is a
superset. The one frame the relay never carries is ``_kiro/auth/getAccessToken``,
which is the point.

Neither route brings a sandbox of its own, and this is the reason Crew's own
seatbelt must stay on (see ``ACP_BACKENDS_INTERNAL_SANDBOX`` in
:mod:`kiro_crew.acp.types`). KAS implements its own OS sandbox -- seatbelt on
macOS, bubblewrap on Linux -- selected by an ``--sandbox`` argument on its ACP
server, and it wraps each bash command rather than the agent process. kiro-cli's
relay does NOT pass that argument (``spawn_kas_process`` builds exactly
``node --experimental-wasm-modules <acp-server.js> --transport=stdio
--auth=acp-callback``), and KAS's sandbox factory returns its no-op backend for
an absent config. So KAS runs with no OS sandbox of its own either way: the argv
kiro-cli builds is byte-for-byte the argv Crew would build itself. Two
consequences: there is no inner sandbox that could fail to nest inside Crew's
seatbelt, and there is nothing for Crew to delegate isolation TO -- claiming the
delegation would leave KAS unconfined on macOS.
