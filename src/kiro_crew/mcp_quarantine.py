"""Consecutive-probe-failure quarantine for MCP servers.

A probe verdict was display-only AND forgotten between rounds. ``probe_server``
could time out on the same server eight times running and nothing anywhere
could say so: the two probe caches are process memory with a 600s and a 1800s
TTL, neither carries a consecutive-failure count, and the dashboard row showed
only the latest single reading. An error badge looked identical whether a server
had failed once on a cold cache or forty times in a row.

This module is the missing durable fact: a per-server count of CONSECUTIVE
failed probes, which the row then reports.

It does NOT unmount the failing server. Every lever for that is unsafe, because
the generated agent config is simultaneously the mount decision and the only home
for agent-scope MCP configuration. Nothing here writes any config file.

Nor does it ever write ``disabled``. That key is the USER's choice, living in
``~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json``; a count that flipped it would be
indistinguishable from the user having turned the server off, and a later probe
success could silently re-enable something they had switched off by hand. The
count lives only in this store, so clearing it is one counter reset.

Why a counter and not a single failure: a probe spawns a real process and one
failure is routinely transient (a cold npm cache, a laptop that just woke, a
registry blip). The claim being made is that a server is *consistently*
unreachable, which is the case worth reporting.

Statuses that carry no verdict are ignored rather than counted as either
outcome -- ``disabled`` (never probed), ``unknown`` / ``outdated`` (no fresh
result), and ``needs_auth``, which is a server working correctly and telling us
it wants a token. Counting ``needs_auth`` would quarantine every OAuth
connection the user has not signed into yet.
