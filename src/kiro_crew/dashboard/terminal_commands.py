"""Subcommand and flag completion for the web terminal's inline menu.

The path tier (``handlers/terminal.py``) answers "which FILE did you mean". This
module answers "which SUBCOMMAND or FLAG did you mean" — the ``gh pr cre⎸`` case,
where the alternative is the user going to read ``--help``.

Authority model
---------------
The path tier reads directories, and its justification is that it grants nothing
the session's own ``ls`` does not. This tier RUNS a program, so it needs its own
justification, and the one it has is narrow but exact: **it runs only what
pressing Tab in that same shell already runs.** The entire body of a
cobra-generated bash/zsh completion script is a call to
``<tool> __complete <argv…>``; git's is ``git --list-cmds=…``. Those two
protocols are all this module implements, and nothing else is ever executed.

That claim is load-bearing, so note where it once did NOT hold: a third protocol,
``git <sub> --git-completion-helper``, was implemented and then removed, because
git resolves an alias through config lookup rather than invoking it — Tab would
never have run a ``!``-shell alias body, and that probe would have. The lesson is
that "the tool's own completion script calls this" has to be checked against what
the script does with the ANSWER, not just which command it names.

Five properties keep that claim true rather than aspirational:

* **Allowlist, not discovery.** A command is probed only when it appears in
  ``_KNOWN`` or the operator's ``dashboard.terminal.completion.commands``.
  Speculatively running ``<whatever the user typed> __complete`` is precisely
  what would make this dangerous — ``make __complete`` builds a target called
  ``__complete``, and an ``rm``-shaped tool would act on it — so an unknown
  command yields no completions at all rather than a probe.
* **Bare names, resolved against a sanitized PATH.** The command word must carry
  no ``/``, and PATH is filtered before resolution to absolute entries whose whole
  chain only root or this gateway's own user could have written, so a hostile
  ``gh`` dropped in the session's cwd, in a project tool directory, or reached
  through a relative or empty PATH entry can never be the file that runs. See
  ``_sanitized_path`` for what that ownership rule does and does not bound.
* **No shell, ever.** An argv LIST handed to ``execve``. The words are never
  joined into a string that something would re-split, so a metacharacter in a word
  the user is mid-way through typing has nothing to escape into.
* **Sandboxed like any agent-influenced spawn, at the STRICTEST tier.** Routed
  through ``sandbox.sandboxed_spawn_argv(..., "strict")`` — every credential
  directory hidden, not just the non-workflow ones the default ``standard`` tier
  covers — plus a credential-scrubbed environment, and spawned with
  ``create_subprocess_limited`` (resource limits). The allowlist bounds WHICH
  program runs but not what an argument can ask that program to do, and a terminal
  line is writable by the agent — the "run in terminal" affordance — as well as by
  the user, so the argv is treated as agent-influenced. A probe needs no
  credential to read a static subcommand table, so the strictest tier costs
  nothing here. ``test_spawn_audit.py`` is the gate that enforces the routing.
* **Bounded.** stdin is ``/dev/null`` (a probe that decides to prompt sees EOF
  instead of hanging), stderr is discarded (cobra writes a human-readable
  directive line there), stdout is capped, a wall-clock timeout kills the process
  TREE, and a module-wide semaphore caps concurrent probes so a room full of
  typists cannot fork-bomb the gateway.
* **Answered from cache, not from a process, per keystroke.** The candidate list
  is a pure function of (binary identity, argv path, subcommands-or-flags), so a
  probe runs once per argv PATH and every subsequent keystroke narrows the cached
  list in-process. ``gh pr c`` → ``cre`` → ``creat`` is one subprocess, not three.

What this deliberately does NOT do
----------------------------------
Complete the command NAME itself (``gh`` from ``g⎸``). That needs a PATH-wide
executable scan, which is a different data source with a different cost profile
and its own disclosure question; the menu stays shut while the command word is
still being typed, exactly as before.

Positional VALUES (a branch name, a container id) are not a target either, but the
honest statement is narrower than "excluded": at a leaf position a cobra tool
answers a bare ``__complete`` from its own ``ValidArgsFunction`` rather than from a
subcommand table, so whatever it returns arrives through the same wire format and
— if it is shape-valid — is shown as a subcommand row. Two things bound that.
``strict`` sandboxing hides the credentials such a completer would need, so the
cluster- and account-backed ones (``kubectl get pod ⎸``) resolve to nothing rather
than to a live API call from the gateway. And ``is_command_token`` drops anything
that is not shaped like a token, which most identifiers are not. What remains is a
tool whose leaf values happen to look like subcommands and need no credential;
those are offered, and they are useful, but they are not what this tier set out to
provide and are not labelled differently.

      points above: the probe fires while the line is still being TYPED, so a
      binary planted anywhere on PATH would run before the user could decide not
      to run it. ``_is_trusted_dir`` therefore requires every component of the
      chain to be owned by root or by the user this gateway runs as, and writable
      by nobody else.

    A ROOT-owned chain is not a tenable requirement on a developer machine.
    Homebrew installs into a prefix owned by the installing user
    (``/opt/homebrew``, group ``admin``), so requiring uid 0 leaves macOS with only
    the handful of tools shipped in ``/usr/bin`` and drops every one this tier
    exists for: ``gh``, ``docker``, ``kubectl``. A tier that is dead on the most
    common developer platform is an unused code path, not a security win. This is
    the policy ``github_runner.validate_provider_executable`` already applies to
    provider CLIs — accept ``st_uid in (0, uid)``, refuse other accounts, refuse
    world-writable, refuse the agent-writable trees — reached there for the same
    reason: requiring a root-owned copy made every stock ``brew install gh`` fail.

    What the ownership tier costs, stated plainly: the agent runs as the same user
    as the gateway, so a directory kept by this filter is a directory the agent
    could plant a binary in, and typing that tool's name would then run it. Three
    things bound that, and the third is why the trade is worth taking. ``_KNOWN``
    is a closed allowlist, so a plant has to SHADOW a specific real tool name AND
    win PATH order against the genuine install. The plant does not choose the argv.
    And an agent that can write files already holds far more reliable execution
    paths on the same machine — ``~/.zshrc``, a git hook, a LaunchAgent — none of
    which any PATH filter touches, so refusing the user's own install buys no real
    containment. The trees the agent most plausibly writes are excluded by
    location anyway, which is what the bullet above is for.

    There is deliberately NO operator opt-in to widen this further: an
    operator-declared trusted-directory list reinstates the whole vector for
    anyone who uses it, and "the operator consented" does not make an
    agent-writable directory safe to execute from mid-keystroke.
