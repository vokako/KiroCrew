"""OAuth-style refresh tokens for the KiroCrew dashboard.

Adds a paired refresh cookie alongside the existing access cookie
(``mc_token_<port>``) so users do not need to re-mint via the
``kirocrew token`` URL every ~20 hours.

Design (full spec in ``docs/system-specs/modules/dashboard-token-auth.md``):

- Refresh cookie ``mc_refresh_<port>`` is path-restricted to
  ``/api/auth/refresh`` — narrower attack surface than the access cookie.
- Lifetime up to 30 days (``MAX_REFRESH_TTL_SECS``), HMAC-signed with the
  same persistent ``token_signing.key`` secret as the access cookie.
- Rotation-on-use: each ``/api/auth/refresh`` call mints a fresh pair and
  marks the prior ``jti`` consumed.
- Reuse detection (RFC 6819 §5.2.2.3): a consumed ``jti`` presented again
  outside the multi-tab grace window auto-revokes the entire chain.
- 60-second same-IP grace window absorbs benign multi-tab races.
- Peer binding: a chain opened by a daemon-verified tailnet peer records that
  peer, and only that peer may rotate it (see ``bind_chain_peer``).
- Persistence: ``~/.kiro/crew/refresh_chains.json`` (mode ``0600``).

# Grace acceptance is CHAIN-HEAD-ONLY. We retain exactly ONE recently-consumed

# this to a bounded history of the last N consumed jtis so several lagging tabs
# could each authenticate a benign race; that was a deliberate weakening of the
# RFC 6819 §5.2.2.3 reuse signal (any of the last N consumed jtis, replayed
# same-IP within the window, resolved to the live head instead of tripping
# chain revocation) and was flagged by the Design + Long-Term Impact reviewers.
# The maintainer chose the STRONGER posture: only the chain head is accepted, so
# any OLDER rotated jti replayed within the window is treated as token reuse and
# revokes the chain. This restores an undiluted theft signal at the cost of some
# multi-tab UX (a second stale tab racing a refresh may be logged out). The
# single-tab / single-refresh false-revocation race (a duplicate request

def _record_list(data: object, key: str) -> list[dict] | None:
    """Return ``data[key]``'s mapping records, or ``None`` if it is CORRUPT.

    The one place every persisted record list is decoded, and the one place that
    distinguishes the two cases a bare ``.get(key, [])`` collapses together:

    - **absent** (no such key) -> ``[]``. A fresh install has no records, and an
      install that never revoked anything has no ``revoked_chains``. Nothing was
      lost, so empty is the truth.
    - **present but not a list** (``{"revoked_chains": null}``, a scalar, an
      object) -> ``None``, meaning CORRUPT. Records existed and cannot be read.

    That distinction is load-bearing, because these lists are security controls,
    not a cache. Reading a corrupt ``revoked_chains`` as empty makes
    ``is_chain_revoked`` answer False for a chain that ``POST /api/auth/logout``
    already killed, so a stolen refresh cookie rotates into fresh credentials --
    and nothing self-corrects it: reuse detection only re-fires on a jti replay
    the attacker need not cause, so the window persists until an unrelated logout
    or restart. Same shape for ``consumed_jtis`` (RFC 6819 §5.2.2.3 reuse
    detection) and ``chain_peers`` (the device binding, whose loss makes a chain
    replayable from any allowed node). :meth:`_load` therefore marks the store
    DEGRADED on ``None`` and :func:`validate_refresh_token` refuses to rotate,
    rather than silently dropping the control.

    A non-mapping ELEMENT is different again and is simply filtered: the callers'
    per-field guards already skip it, and one junk entry beside good ones is not
    evidence the good ones are untrustworthy.

    Note what this does NOT change: an unparseable or unreadable FILE keeps
    starting empty (see :meth:`_load`). ``atomic_write`` makes a torn write
    impossible, so a file that will not parse at all is better read as "not our
    state" than as "our records, lost" -- and that behaviour is pinned by
    ``test_tr_i_17_corrupted_state_file_starts_empty``.

    Deliberately a chokepoint rather than three guards: the original crash was
    reported against ``chain_peers`` alone, but it was never specific to that
    key, and guarding only the reported one leaves the identical defect on its
    two siblings.
