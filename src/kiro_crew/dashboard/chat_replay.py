"""Render a resumed session's transcript from kiro-cli's ``session/load`` replay.

Prototype behind ``dashboard.replay_from_acp`` (default off).

Today a resumed dashboard session shows the JSONL Kiro Crew wrote turn by turn,
while the frames kiro-cli replays during ``session/load`` -- the agent's OWN
record of the conversation -- are counted and dropped by the runtime's reader.
With the flag on, :class:`~kiro_crew.acp.runtime.AcpRuntime` keeps those frames
(``AcpSessionHandle.replay_updates``) and this module turns them into transcript
rows through the SAME parser the live path uses -- reached through
:func:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.fold_replay_updates`, the SDK's driver seam, so this
dashboard module never imports the ACP layer -- then overlays from the JSONL only
what the agent never saw.

Measured split (research/acp-replay, kiro-cli 2.21.0, engines v1/v2/v3):

* replay is authoritative for assistant text, thinking text, and every tool
  call's id / rawInput / rawOutput / final status;
* replay carries each user turn as the FULL assembled prompt (system prompt,
  context blocks, the user's words after ``[CURRENT USER REQUEST -- respond to
  this]``), so the clean user text comes from the JSONL row when one matches;
  a turn the DASHBOARD dispatched (a cron notification, a sub-agent completion,
  a recovery re-send, the synthesis prompt) is persisted as an ``inject`` /
  ``subagent`` row rather than ``user``, and is matched as that turn's prompt
  the same way (see ``_is_prompt_row``);
* on the v1/v2 engines a replayed tool call's ``title`` collapses to the raw
  tool name and ``locations`` are gone, so the humanized title / purpose / kind
  are borrowed from the JSONL tool row with the same ``tool_call_id``;
* notices, errors, approvals, steer provenance, in-turn injects, compaction
  banners and cron/subagent labels exist only in the JSONL -- they are the
  sidecar and are re-inserted at their turn, anchored on the last replayed row
  (tool call or answer text) they followed in the JSONL, if any.

Every emitted row is tagged ``meta.source`` (``acp_replay`` | ``jsonl``) so the
dashboard can show where it came from. The JSONL keeps being written -- this
changes what a resumed session READS, never what it persists.

# ── Merge cache + rewrite invalidation ─────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The frames never change for a resumed session, so one merge is reused while
# the JSONL corpus is unchanged -- the detail endpoint is polled on every
# reconnect and turn end, and re-walking a multi-thousand-frame replay each time
# is a real cost. Two things break the reuse and are handled here:
#
# * rows mutate IN PLACE after they are appended (a permission row gets
#   ``resolved``, a tool row gets ``done``/``output``, an assistant row gets
#   ``turn_stats``), so the cache witness folds those fields in per row;
# * the transcript is REWRITTEN (rewind, regenerate, edit-and-resend, variant
#   switch): the replay then describes a conversation that does not exist any more, so
#   the rewrite endpoints call :func:`discard_replay_for_slot`, which drops both
#   the cached rows and the provider's frames -- the next render is the JSONL.

#: slot key -> ((frame count, corpus witness), rows, report, bytes). Bounded on
#: BOTH axes: an entry count, so an operator with many slots does not
#: accumulate one merged transcript per slot, and an aggregate byte ceiling,
#: because 64 entries of a multi-MB transcript each is gateway memory a count
#: alone does not bound. A single merge past ``_MERGE_CACHE_ENTRY_MAX_BYTES``
#: is served but never cached -- re-merging it on the next fetch is cheaper
#: than pinning that much memory for one slot. Oldest entries go first.
