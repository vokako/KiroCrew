"""Publish (and unpublish) the dashboard on this machine's tailnet.

The write half of tailnet access. The config switch only makes the gateway
*trust* the tailnet origin; putting the dashboard ON the tailnet is a separate
``tailscale serve`` call, and this module is what runs it. Without it the switch
is a working-looking control that changes nothing observable, and reaching the
dashboard needs a second command the UI never mentions.

Deliberately a **separate module from** :mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.tailnet`, whose
documented contract is the opposite of what a write path needs:

* ``tailnet`` is read-only enrichment and **swallows every failure** — a missing
  binary, a stopped daemon and a timeout all collapse to ``None``, because its
  caller only wants "a name or nothing" and must not be able to break startup.
* Here a failure is the **entire point of the call**. ``tailscale serve`` refuses
  for reasons the operator can act on and cannot guess — most often because
  changing serve config needs root or an ``--operator`` grant — so collapsing
  those to a bare "failed" would reproduce the unexplained-refusal problem this
  feature exists to remove.

Two consequences of having seen almost none of this daemon's real output shape
the code, and both are deliberate rather than provisional (one real status
document — a Windows 1.x daemon holding a single port-80 mapping — is pinned in
the test suite, and it is what justifies the one evidence-based narrowing here,
:func:`_has_port_shaped_keys`; everything else stays schema-agnostic):

**The daemon's own output is always passed through verbatim.** ``code`` is a
best-effort classification for the UI to branch on; ``detail`` carries what
Tailscale actually said — stderr first, but stdout too, because upstream prints
some of its most actionable messages there (the Serve enablement URL among
them), and a timeout hands over whatever was captured before the deadline. If
the classification is wrong or the phrasing changes upstream, the operator
still sees the real reason instead of our guess at it.

**Published-state detection does not depend on the JSON schema.** Rather than
reading key paths from ``tailscale serve status --json`` that are unverified here,
:func:`serve_state` searches the parsed document for a proxy target naming our own
port. That is robust to a schema this code has never observed, and an
unrecognisable document reports ``unknown`` rather than ``not published`` — the
difference matters, because "not published" invites a publish the node may not
need while ``unknown`` says plainly that we could not tell.

    """Stop serving the dashboard on the tailnet — **only if 443 is ours**.

    Narrow in two ways, both enforced rather than merely documented.

    **The removal names its mount.** Upstream's ``unsetServe`` treats an absent
    ``--set-path`` as "every mount under this port" — it collects all handlers and
    deletes them — so a port-wide ``off`` destroys sibling handlers an operator
    added by hand, and prompts interactively when there is more than one (which a
    CLI with no TTY cannot answer). Passing ``--set-path`` removes exactly the
    handler we created.

    **Ownership is decided for that mount, not for the port.** ``serve_state`` must
    confirm the handler at ``SERVE_MOUNT`` on ``SERVE_HTTPS_PORT`` is this
    dashboard; "ours is somewhere under 443" was true while a stranger's handler sat
    at the mount actually being removed.

    An **undetermined** state refuses too, and that is the deliberate half. This
    code has seen almost none of the real ``tailscale serve status --json``
    shapes in the wild (one document is pinned in the test suite), so "I could
    not tell" must not be treated as "go ahead": the two costs are not symmetric —
    wrongly proceeding destroys configuration the operator has to rebuild from
    memory, while wrongly refusing costs one copy-pasted command, which the
    refusal prints.

    Still **not gated on governance**, unchanged and for the unchanged reason:
    ``is_governance_pinned_off`` returns true both for a real deny and for a
    ceiling it could not evaluate, so gating withdrawal would let a transient
    policy-read failure leave a dashboard published with no supported way to take
    it down — a fail-closed control failing open in effect.
