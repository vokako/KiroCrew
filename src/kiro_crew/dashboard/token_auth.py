# entry to the method whose handler does its own auth leaves the rest on the
# ordinary token gate. Every self-authenticating webhook belongs here rather than
# in the path-only set above, whether or not another route currently collides —
# the collision is a property of the route table, which moves.
#
# ``POST /api/hooks/agent`` is the inbound agent webhook: external systems (CI
# runners, code-review bots, deploy pipelines) post here holding a webhook token
# and nothing else — no dashboard cookie, no gateway IPC secret. The handler does
# its OWN auth (api_hooks_agent -> _verify_hook_token compares the bearer against
# the sha256 of every stored token entry with hmac.compare_digest and refuses
# with 401 when none match, including when no token exists at all, so the
# endpoint is closed by default on a fresh install). It is a deliberate exposure
# decision: a valid token authorizes a real agent turn with full tool access, so
# the handler also rate-limits repeated failures per source
# (webhooks.auth_throttle) and records every 401 in the run history.
#
# For that entry the method scope is load-bearing, not tidiness. The literal
# string ``agent`` also matches the ``{hook_id}`` wildcard of the dashboard's own
# hook CRUD routes — PUT and DELETE ``/api/hooks/{hook_id}`` — whose handler
# (api_hook_detail) authenticates via the dashboard token alone. Unscoped, both
# reach it with no credential of any kind.
#
# ``POST /api/messaging/teams`` is the Microsoft Teams inbound webhook: Bot
# Framework (Microsoft's servers, no dashboard cookie) posts activities there and
# the handler does its OWN auth, validating the Bot Framework JWT (issuer +
# App-ID audience + signature) before processing. Only POST is routed today, so
# the scope closes nothing yet — it is here so the shape a future entry gets
# copied from is the safe one.

#: The Bot Framework inbound webhook route. Named once because TWO independent
#: middleware exemptions target it (the token gate below and the CSRF Origin
#: check in ``server``), and a hand-copied second spelling is how one control
#: ends up pointed at a route the other is not.

# Exact-path exemptions from the CSRF **Origin** check, path -> allowed methods.
# A separate map from the token-auth bypass above, deliberately: skipping the
# cookie gate and skipping the Origin check are two different grants, and a route
# may need one without the other.
#
# ONE entry, and adding a second is a security review rather than a copy of this
# line. `/api/hooks/agent` shares the shape -- self-authenticating, cookie-less,
# server-to-server -- and is in the token-auth bypass above, but it is NOT here:
# no reported failure named it, its own proxy topologies already work, and a
# perimeter exemption is far harder to withdraw once a caller depends on it than
# it is to add later with its own cause.
#
# WHY dropping the Origin check is sound for the Teams route: CSRF exists to stop
# a BROWSER making a cross-origin state-changing request that the browser then
# decorates with the victim's cookies. ``api_teams_activity`` reads no cookie at
# all, so there is nothing for a cross-origin page to ride; it authenticates the
# Bot Framework JWT instead (issuer, App-ID audience, RS256 signature over the
# Bot Framework JWKS, expiry). A cross-origin page can neither obtain nor forge
# one, so an Origin the check would have rejected buys an attacker nothing.
#
# WHY the exemption is REQUIRED and not a convenience: the Connector is
# server-to-server and sends neither ``Origin`` nor ``Referer``.
# ``origin.check_origin`` trusts a header-less request only from a loopback peer
# or the dashboard's unix socket, so such a POST arriving straight at the gateway
# is refused 403 before the credential is ever examined -- which is the "public
# hostname on a VM/App Service" topology in ``docs/teams-integration.md``.
# Nothing an operator can configure widens it: unlike the Host allowlist, which
# ``dashboard.url`` feeds, there is no setting that admits an Origin-less
# non-loopback POST.
#
# The METHOD scope is load-bearing: only POST is exempt, so the ``PUT``/``DELETE``
# ``/api/hooks/{hook_id}`` CRUD routes -- whose handler authenticates by dashboard
# token alone -- keep their Origin check even though the literal ``agent`` matches
# their wildcard.

    **Why this exists.** App-ownership checks gate on ``request["app"]``, which
    the app-token branch publishes. The internal-secret branch (the managed MCP
    set) carries no app claim at all: the secret proves the call came from
    inside, not who made it. Without this, every ownership check is a no-op on
    that transport, and an app agent granted ``@kirocrew-dashboard`` arrives
    indistinguishable from the dashboard user.

    The identity comes from the authenticated CALLING SESSION, resolved against
    server-side registries in four steps -- one per way a session can be owned:
    the slot the key names, the slot RUNNING under that key
    (``linked_session_key``), for a cron key the job's ``created_by`` owner tag,
    and for a subagent key the child record's spawning ``app``. The agent cannot
    forge the key — it does not build the request; the in-process MCP broker sets
    it from the calling session's own context and never from tool arguments
    (``mcp_core`` ``_resolve_session_key_strict``), and on an AF_UNIX transport
    ``_verify_unix_peer`` has already kernel-attested it against ``/proc``
    ancestry before this runs.

    ``""`` means "no app owns this caller" and is returned both when the person
    is the caller and when the caller cannot be placed at all. The two are not
    distinguished because no site acts differently on them; the one route that
    needs the difference for a ``dashboard:`` key asks
    :func:`caller_names_a_missing_slot` instead.

    Deliberately PURE — every parameter is a server-side registry or the
    caller's own key, never a request — so the middleware and the one route that
    also re-derives for defense-in-depth share a single implementation that
    cannot drift. Never derive from a request BODY or from tool arguments: a

    ALL requests require a valid token — loopback is no longer exempt

    remote traffic appear as 127.0.0.1, bypassing auth entirely.

    *internal_paths* are exact paths that internal processes (mcp-core,
    doctor) call — these require loopback AND a matching
    ``X-Internal-Secret`` header (read from ``~/.kiro/crew/.local_secret``).
    Non-loopback access to these paths is always denied.

    *mixed_internal_paths* are paths called by BOTH internal processes
    (loopback + secret) AND the browser (cookie auth).  On non-loopback
    they perform explicit cookie validation (deny-by-default) instead
    of hard-denying, so DCV/SSH-forwarded browsers polling these routes
    (e.g. ``/api/spawn`` every 5s) don't trigger false session-expired
    banners.  Use this for any internal-path that the browser polls.

    *tailnet_trust* is the operator's identity-trust opt-in (RFC §2–§3.1,
    validated at config load). When set and enabled, a request arriving from
    the local ``tailscale serve`` proxy is attributed to the daemon-verified
    tailnet peer: the session pin binds to a ``ts:``-prefixed peer key instead of
    the proxy's loopback address, the allowlist is enforced, and audit records
    name the login. When ``None`` (the default, and every failure mode of the
    resolution) behaviour is byte-for-byte the existing token+IP path, except
    for sessions carrying ``require_peer=1``: those explicitly opt out of the
    fallback and fail closed until the daemon verifies an allowed peer.
