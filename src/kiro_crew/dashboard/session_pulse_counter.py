"""Durable per-install count of genuine user-initiated chat sessions.

Gates the session-pulse survey's "new user" window: the survey must not appear
until this install has started at least ``NEW_USER_SESSION_THRESHOLD`` genuine
user chats (``SlotOrigin.USER``). Counting only user-origin sessions whose
creation path opts in via ``count_user_session`` -- not cron, app, system,
restored-untagged slots, or agent-driven session-control creates (which mint
USER-origin slots for privacy semantics but are not a person chatting) -- keeps
the gate a measure of real human engagement, matching the only surface the
survey ever shows on.

The count is persisted next to the other dashboard state files via
``config_dir()`` so it honors ``KIROCREW_HOME`` and survives restarts. The
in-memory ``_slot_counter`` in state.py cannot serve this: it resets to 0 on
every gateway boot and only reseeds past currently-live slots, so it is not a
lifetime count.

Both functions are best-effort and never raise into their callers: a survey
timing gate must not be able to break session creation or the eligibility
check. On any read/write trouble they log and fall back (read -> 0, which keeps
a new-ish install gated shut rather than surfacing the survey on bad data).

    ``get_or_create_slot`` is synchronous and runs on the gateway loop for every

    fork all reach it -- so doing this module's read, ``mkdir``, tempfile
    write and ``os.replace`` inline stalls the whole loop on slow or contended
    storage.

    Nothing reads the count until the survey's own eligibility check, and the
    increment is already best-effort (it swallows its own I/O errors and returns
    the pre-increment value), so a slot birth has no reason to wait for it.

    Offloaded HERE rather than by making the caller async: the allocation inside
    ``get_or_create_slot`` must not suspend part-way, because callers depend on
    the slot being fully configured before anything else can observe it.
    Offloading the allocation would open exactly that window; offloading the I/O
    does not.

    Fire-and-forget by design: the future is not awaited, which is safe only
    because the callee cannot raise. A count lost to shutdown racing the executor
    is acceptable for a survey timing gate and matches the best-effort contract
    the module already documents.
