"""``file_send``'s destination oracle -- the one place that answers "where does
this file go, and may this caller send it there?" for BOTH delivery legs.

The two legs of ``file_send`` share one ADMISSION gate
(:func:`~kiro_crew.dashboard.handlers.files._gate_upload_file`: containment, the
descriptor-safe read, the binary MIME allowlist, the content credential scans).
This module is the destination half: keeping the two resolvers per-leg and inline
in each endpoint is what produces "two paths, two behaviours". Here they sit side
by side in one file, each endpoint keeps only its own delivery verb and response
shape, and every rung one leg runs and the other does not is written down below
instead of being discoverable only by reading two handlers 200 lines apart.

This is deliberately NOT a single ``resolve(leg, ...)`` dispatcher. Each endpoint
knows its leg statically, so a union-typed dispatcher would buy nothing and force
both call sites to unwrap a wider result. What makes this one oracle is that both
resolvers live here, share one refusal/skip vocabulary, and are audited through
one shape (``_audit_file_send`` in the handlers module, which owns the
test-patchable ``_sel``).

Rung by rung. Both legs run the same two ceilings -- the ``channels``-scope
governance vet and the restricted-session ceiling -- but the Slack leg calls them
DIRECTLY (:func:`_slack_egress_permitted`) rather than joining
``channel_transports``, because its dedicated client genuinely cannot ride the
shared ladder. The rows
that still differ differ for a reason named in the row:

module stays free of both the Slack handler's tracked-channel config dependency
and the ``handlers`` package it is called from.

    destination a REQUEST can name -- as the one unvetted, unaudited file egress.
    Same shape as the other Slack egress that cannot reach the ladder
    (``chat_compaction_notice._channel_egress_permitted``): a direct call to the

    "transports the shared ladder can drive".

    An empty key is a caller with no session of its own -- a cron, the heartbeat,
    an out-of-band host action -- reaching this leg through the owner-DM
    fallback. It is vetted under ``HOST_SESSION_KEY`` for the same reason

    classifies as ``unknown`` and matches no profile at all, so vetting under it
    would make host-side governance inert here, while ``_host`` is the stable
    bind target operators attach it to. A legitimate owner-DM send therefore
    stays permitted on an ungoverned host, and is deniable by an explicit host
    binding rather than by a fall-through.

    Fail-closed: a degraded evaluation denies. ``PlatformCompositionError``
    propagates -- an unusable governance ceiling is a host misconfiguration, not
    a routine authorization answer, and must not be reported as one.
