"""Generate intent-level session summaries after a turn completes.

The pass runs on the shared background session, off the turn's critical path,
and is best-effort throughout: every failure path leaves the previous cached
summary in place rather than replacing it with something worse. Nothing here
raises into the caller.

The prompt carries an explicit trap list. Each entry is a transcript shape that
produced a confidently wrong summary when this was prototyped against real
sessions -- not a hypothetical. The mechanically detectable ones (automation
posting under the user role, verbatim resends) are already labelled by
:mod:`kiro_crew.session_summary` before the model sees them; the rest are
judgement calls the prompt has to name.

_PROMPT = """\
Summarize this chat session by INTENT, for a panel whose only job is to make \
returning to the session cheap.

An INTENT is a goal the person was pursuing. It can span many turns. It is NOT \
one message, and it is NOT a topic label. A session with a pivot has several \
intents. Turn numbers below refer to the USER turn numbers shown in the \
transcript.

Return ONLY a JSON object, no prose around it, in exactly this shape:

{
  "intents": [
    {
      "title": "short goal, in the person's terms",
      "ranges": [[first_user_turn, last_user_turn]],
      "status": "active" | "completed" | "abandoned",
      "verified": true | false | null,
      "origin_turn": <user turn that triggered this intent, or null>,
      "initial_intent": "why the work started, stated as the person would",
      "progress": ["what is actually true now", "..."],
      "next_steps": [
        {"what": "the action", "why": "why it matters", "expect": "what happens if they do it"}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "constraints": ["how this project has to be run -- recurring operational facts"]
}

FIELD RULES

- "ranges" is a LIST. Use several when an intent went dormant and resumed. \
Ranges may overlap another intent's: an intent pursued inside a longer one is \
real, and forcing them apart would misdescribe the session.
- "status" is about the WORK: active if it is still being pursued, completed if \
it was carried to an end, abandoned if it was dropped.
- "verified" is about the RESULT, and is independent of status. false means the \
outcome was never actually confirmed -- shipped but never looked at, diagnosed \
but never fixed, merged but never run. null means confirmation does not apply. \
This distinction is the single most useful thing in the summary: work whose \
discussion ended while the goal was never reached is exactly what a person \
forgets.
- "progress" is a RUNBOOK, not a history. Say what is true now and what is \
known to work, not a turn-by-turn replay. Length is inversely proportional to \
value here; a long progress list is a worse summary.
- "next_steps" are YOUR inferences, and will be shown as such. Only include \
steps that are genuinely open. An intent that needs nothing gets an empty list.
- "constraints" are session-scoped operational facts about this project -- the \
things the person would otherwise re-learn the hard way (a required flag, a \
step that has to happen after a change, a name they corrected you on). Not \
general preferences. At most a handful, or leave it empty.

BOUNDARY SIGNALS, most reliable first

- A commit, merge, or PR being opened punctuates a session more reliably than \
any phrasing.
- Timestamps separate a routine that is re-run daily from a request that failed \
and was retried. A message repeated across days is a routine.
- A correction from the person ("no", "revert that", "that broke it") is the \
highest-value signal per character in the whole transcript. Weight it heavily \
and never summarize away a correction.

TRAPS -- each of these has produced a wrong summary before

1. A row labelled "[automation, not the user]" is not the person. Never treat \
it as intent, and never create an intent for it.
2. A row labelled as a resend is not insistence and not evidence that the \
request was ignored. The first attempt usually succeeded.
3. A later message can RETRACT an earlier one ("I was wrong", "revert this -- \
it broke my notes"). The retraction is the truth. Never report a feature that \
was withdrawn, or a bug that was walked back, as current.
4. Lines offering the person choices are options they were given, and mostly \
DECLINED. Never read an offer as something the person asked for.
5. Work being merged is not work being verified. If the transcript shows \
something shipped without being run or seen, that intent is completed with \
"verified": false.
6. A question is not a work order. "How hard would it be to..." or "do not \
change anything yet" is not an intent -- if a question caused the next goal, \
record it as that intent's "origin_turn" instead.
7. Facts go stale inside one session: a version, size, path or count stated \
early may have changed by the end. Prefer the latest statement.
8. A context reset or compaction mid-session is not a topic boundary.
9. The session's own title covers only its beginning and is often wrong about \
the whole. Do not anchor on it.
