"""Inject a finished workflow run's result back into the originating chat.

When a background workflow run reaches a terminal state, the registry fires
``on_done`` → this injects a summary + result into the chat session that started
it, so the agent can continue the conversation with the workflow's output (the
whole point of the chat integration). Mirrors ``cron_inject`` — appends to the
linked dashboard slot and persists to the conversation log so a follow-up turn
has it as context. LLM-derived text is redacted before delivery.

If the run had no originating session (e.g. launched from the Workflows tab with
no chat link), the result simply isn't injected — the tab already shows it.
