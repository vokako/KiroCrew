"""Session transfer — copy a session between Kiro Crew instances.

Two halves live here:

* :func:`build_transfer_bundle_async` serialises one slot's visible conversation
  into a portable, version-tagged dict. Called on the **sending** side.
* :func:`api_chat_slot_import` accepts such a dict and materialises it as a new
  slot. Called on the **receiving** side.

The wire hop between them is an ordinary authenticated dashboard request over
an Instances tunnel; see [instances.md](../../../docs/system-specs/modules/instances.md) §14.

**Two layers travel.** *Layer A* is the visible transcript (the bundle's
``messages``) — what the imported tab DISPLAYS. *Layer B* (bundle_version 2) is
the kiro-cli context window itself (``<sid>.json`` + ``<sid>.jsonl``, stored
outside the crew home and joined via ``session_map.json``): carrying it lets the
imported session RESUME with full fidelity through ``session/load`` rather than
replaying the transcript as a lossy ~8K prefix. Layer B is optional — a v1
sender, or a session that never opened a kiro-cli context, ships Layer A only
and the peer falls back to the prefix. Sub-agent conversations do NOT travel;
their results already live inside Layer B as injected context.

**Copy, never move.** Import always allocates a NEW slot key and never touches
an existing session, so a transfer leaves the source intact and can be repeated
safely. Nothing here deletes anything.

**What deliberately does NOT travel.** A session's transcript is portable text,
but most of its *metadata* is a reference into the local instance's object graph
— a project path, a folder id, a workspace's memory, an agent template, a bound
artifact. Carrying those across would produce dangling references that render
as broken UI on arrival, so the bundle carries the transcript, the title, and an
agent *hint* only:

* ``project`` is intentionally dropped. The source's checkout path almost never
  exists on the target host (a Mac worktree path on a Linux dev desk), and a
  slot pointing at a missing directory scopes file search and steering to
  nothing. The imported session arrives with no project so the user re-picks it.
* ``model`` is not carried. Accounts differ in entitlement, so a model id that
  the source account is served can fail at runtime on the target; the target
  resolves its own default instead (see
  docs/system-specs/common/model-selection.md).
* ``workspace`` is not carried. Workspaces are per-instance memory scopes, and a
  name that matches on both hosts still means two different memories.
* ``agent`` is carried as a hint and applied ONLY if the target has an agent by
  that name; otherwise it is dropped rather than left dangling.
* ``folder_id``, ``tags``, ``pinned``, ``artifact``, ``app``,
  ``linked_session_key`` and ``forked_from`` are all local-graph references and
  are not carried at all.

    """Serialise *slot*'s visible conversation into a portable bundle, with the
    disk read off the event loop.

    Carries the FULL conversation rather than only the window currently held in
    memory — a long-running session keeps just its tail resident, and bundling
    ``slot.messages`` alone would silently truncate the transfer to that tail.
    *origin* is a human label for where the session came from (an instance name
    or ``"local"``); it is recorded for provenance and shown on arrival.

    The un-flushed tail is a ``_disk_window_len`` boundary slice, which is valid
    only because the flush below runs first: the save folds a durable injector's
    ``append_if_absent`` copy into the window and advances the boundary, so the
    counter is honest by the time the tail is snapshotted. A caller that bundled
    WITHOUT flushing could not use this slice — a durable injector
    (``cron_inject``, ``workflow_inject``, ``crew_chat``) puts the same row into
    the window and onto disk without a save, so the boundary would start one row
    too early and ship the injection twice. There is deliberately no such
    caller: this is the only builder, and it always flushes.

    The transcript read is synchronous file IO plus JSON parsing over a whole
    session, which is exactly the "large synchronous file IO" the
    ``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`` rule forbids on the loop: on a long
    session it stalls every other task, and because the liveness heartbeat is
    itself a coroutine a stalled loop cannot pet LoopStallWatchdog, which then
    exits the gateway.

    **Offloading introduces an await, so the snapshot must be checked for
    consistency.** While we are off the loop the periodic 5s flush can run: it
    writes the dirty tail to disk AND advances ``_resumed_count`` / clears
    ``_dirty``. If that lands between our read and our merge, a naive merge reads
    pre-flush disk content and then sees a clean slot — silently dropping the
    tail from the copy.

    Because a completed flush advances ``_disk_window_len`` (the persisted
    boundary) as it writes, an unchanged value across the await is positive proof
    that no flush landed: ``history`` then corresponds exactly to
    ``messages[:_disk_window_len]``, so the tail merge is consistent. On a change
    we retry against the new state. Messages arriving during the await are
    harmless — they extend the tail we are about to copy, they do not move the
    boundary.

    If the retries are exhausted (a flush would have to land inside every one of
    them, which the 5s cadence makes effectively impossible), the transfer
    **fails** with :class:`SnapshotUnstable`. It deliberately does not fall back
    to an inline read: that would trade a lossy transcript for a blocking one,
    and on a large active session the blocking read is what starves the heartbeat
    into a watchdog-triggered gateway exit. Failing costs nothing here — a
    transfer is a copy, so the source is untouched and the user can just retry —
    which makes it strictly better than either losing turns or wedging the
    gateway.
