"""Read-only interface to the local Tailscale daemon.

Answers one question for now: *what MagicDNS name does this machine have on its
tailnet?* — so the dashboard can accept its own tailnet origin without the
operator hand-writing ``dashboard.url``. RFC:
``docs/request-for-change/rfc-tailnet-dashboard-access.md`` §4.

Two properties are load-bearing and neither is optional:

**Nothing here raises.** A missing binary, a stopped daemon, a timeout, a
non-zero exit, malformed JSON, an unexpected schema — every one returns ``None``.
The dashboard must start on a host that has never heard of Tailscale, so this
module is a pure enrichment: it either contributes a name or contributes nothing.

**The name is validated before it is returned.** It arrives from a subprocess and
its destination is the CSRF origin allowlist and the DNS-rebinding ``Host``
barrier, so an unvalidated value would be an origin-injection primitive. See
:func:`_valid_magicdns_name`: structure is checked as a strict allowlist, and the
name must additionally sit under the tailnet's own MagicDNS suffix *as the daemon
reports it* — not a suffix hardcoded here, because upstream documents the suffix
as tailnet-specific (its own example is ``userfoo.tailscale.net``, not
``ts.net``).

    A close mirror of ``beacon.is_governance_pinned_off``, deliberately: the two
    answer the same shape of question about the same archetype, and a second,
    subtly-different probe is how two chokepoints on one scope come to disagree.
    The differences from beacon are only the scope name and the audit tool names.

    Pass ``audit_tool`` (a tool name) from an ENFORCEMENT call site so the
    decision routes through the audited ``vet_and_audit`` seam, which writes a
    ``governance_decision`` SEL record for the grant or the denial.
    :func:`resolve_tailnet_host` and both write chokepoints do this, so a
    suppressed derivation and a refused write each leave a forensic record.

    It is deliberately NOT the default. This probe is also a pure READ from
    ``GET /api/tailnet/status``, which the dashboard's tailnet card refetches;
    auditing there would append HMAC-chained SEL rows on mere inspection, at a
    multiple of the one decision per boot that actually governs anything — audit
    the decision that *does* something, not the question.

    The Level-1 POLICY answer, resolved through the standard chokepoint helper so
    this decision comes from the same evaluator as every other governed surface.
    Public because the dashboard card must distinguish "off because the operator
    left the switch off" (flippable) from "off because an administrator pinned it"
    (not flippable, and a config write would be refused).

    FAIL-CLOSED on an evaluation error, for the same asymmetry beacon documents.
    The two dispositions look symmetric and are not:

    * The wrong-DENY costs the operator a convenience: ``tailscale serve`` keeps
      failing the Origin check exactly as it does today with the feature off, and
      an explicit ``dashboard.url`` still works. Nothing is lost that was not
      already the status quo.
    * The wrong-PERMIT **widens the CSRF origin allowlist and the DNS-rebinding
      ``Host`` barrier on a fleet that forbade it** — it grows the set of origins
      the gateway will accept authenticated, state-changing requests from. That is
      a security boundary, not a feature, which puts this with
      ``capabilities.publish`` / ``theme_install`` / ``telemetry``
      (``fail_closed=True``) rather than with the advisory probes.

    ``fail_closed=True`` also makes ``governance_permits`` audit the degrade as a
    critical SEL event, so an operator can see that a ceiling stopped being
    evaluable — precisely the condition under which a silent degrade-to-permit
    would be indefensible.

    Two failure sources are distinguished, because conflating them produces a
    different bug in each direction:

    * A **degrade** (identified by the ``GOVERNANCE_ERROR_REASON`` prefix, not by
      ``rule == "default"`` alone — ``_PERMIT_NOT_GOVERNED`` carries that rule
      too) means no level decided, i.e. the ceiling is unevaluable. Treated as
      pinned, per the fail-closed rationale above.
    * A **profile-layer deny** means the evaluator answered, but from Level 2.
      NOT treated as a pin: ``resolve_active_scope`` returns a synthetic deny-all
      profile (``_deny_all_unloaded:…``) when the profile store is unprimed and
      another thread holds its non-blocking reload lock, so on a host with **no
      policy at all** that transient race would otherwise make the startup
      warning, the 403 and the CLI refusal all blame an administrator who does not
      exist. It arrives as an ordinary ``Decision``, so no ``except`` can catch it
      — which is why this keys on ``layer``, not on ``permitted`` alone. Level-2
      profiles are also per-surface and narrow-only, while this probe runs once at
      gateway startup and carries no session, so a profile denial is not the
      question being asked either way.

    The discriminator a caller needs to fail closed WITHOUT locking anyone out:
    under an unreadable identity policy a peer that could not be attributed must
    be denied, but a request that was never a forwarded tailnet request in the
    first place (loopback, the operator's own browser) resolves to no peer for
    the same reason and must be left alone. Denying on "no peer resolved"
    without asking this first would take the dashboard away from the one person
    who can repair the config.

    Deliberately WEAKER than :func:`_forwarded_peer_candidate`, which answers a
    different question -- "is there exactly one address I may attribute an
    identity to". Attribution demands a single unambiguous address, so it
    rejects a multi-value or comma-joined chain. DENIAL must not: an ambiguous
    chain is still a forwarded tailnet request, so answering "not forwarded"
    there let a caller add a second ``X-Forwarded-For`` header and skip the deny
    entirely, with a valid token doing the rest. Unattributable and absent are
    different things, and only this predicate has to tell them apart.

    So: loopback immediate peer, plus at least one forwarded address anywhere in
    the chain that parses and sits inside the tailnet ranges. A chain carrying
    no tailnet address at all is some other proxy's business and is left alone
    -- widening past the tailnet policy is not this gate's job.

    Synchronous and I/O-free -- the daemon is not consulted, so this is safe to
    ask inline on the event loop.

    dual-site drift, so the trust construction lives here rather than being
    duplicated at each call site. Takes plain values rather than a config
    object to keep this module free of a config import.

    An enterprise ceiling pinning ``capabilities.tailnet_origin`` off disables
    identity trust too: the config-set surfaces refuse the enabling WRITE, but
    a value already stored must not keep request-time whois calls and identity
    pinning alive under a policy that forbids the tailnet integration. The
    probe runs in a thread (it reads the trust-root policy from disk) and is

    ``identity_unknown`` says config load could not read the operator's tailnet
    policy. It is passed as a plain bool for the same reason the others are —
    the caller owns the config read. The ceiling still wins over it: an
    administrator who forbids the tailnet integration outright wants no whois
    calls at all, and with the integration off there is no allowlist left to
    fail closed on.

    ``bind_refresh_chains`` is the availability escape hatch for refresh-chain
    peer binding. It defaults to the SAFER value at every layer,
    including here, so a caller that has not been taught about it cannot
    accidentally construct the unbound posture.

    ``unreadable_files`` names the config file(s) involved, for the refusal to
    quote. It matters more than it looks: the file is often
    ``config.local.json`` rather than ``config.json``, and an operator who has
    just lost REMOTE dashboard access needs the right filename in the one log
    line they can still reach.
