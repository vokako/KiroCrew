"""Shared origin-validation helpers for CSRF and WebSocket checks.

Centralises dashboard URL parsing, bind-address resolution, origin-set
construction, and per-request origin validation so that ``server.py``
(CSRF middleware), ``ws.py`` (WebSocket handshake), and ``gateway.py``
(startup messages) all share a single source of truth.

The only user-facing config is ``dashboard.url`` — a single URL like
``http://my-host.example.com:8080``.  Everything else (port, bind
address, allowed origins) is derived from it.

This module holds the checks that inspect a live ``web.Request``. The
request-independent URL / host / origin-set arithmetic lives in the stdlib-only
:mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.urls` leaf and is re-exported below, so ``from
kiro_crew.dashboard.origin import ...`` keeps working for every existing caller
while CLI and MCP-stdio callers can import the leaf directly and skip the
``aiohttp`` stack.

    The question this answers is narrow and specific: *can anything keyed on
    ``request.remote`` identify one client?* It cannot when a proxy terminated
    the connection, because then every client behind that proxy presents the
    same address.

    The signal is the presence of any :data:`_PROXY_FORWARD_HEADERS` entry, and
    **peer locality is deliberately NOT part of the test**. Two proxy shapes
    exist and both collapse the address:

    * **same-host** — a tunnel or reverse proxy on this machine (cloudflared,
      ngrok, ``tailscale serve``, a local nginx) connecting from loopback; and
    * **upstream** — a proxy on *another* host (an nginx box, a container
      bridge, a LAN jump host) in front of a widened bind
      (``KIROCREW_BIND``), which presents a NON-loopback peer.

    Requiring a loopback peer would be wrong: that rests on the premise that a
    non-loopback peer is the client itself, which holds only when no upstream
    proxy exists — with one, the non-loopback peer is the proxy and the address
    is just as shared. Scoping to loopback therefore reports the second shape as
    per-client, which is the untrue claim this predicate exists to remove.

    Accepted trade-off, stated because it is a deliberate direction: a client
    that sends a forwarding header with no proxy in the path (a transparent
    forward proxy, a misconfigured client) is reported as proxied when its
    address is in fact its own. That is an OVER-warning. On a surface whose job
    is to say whether a security control is effective, over-warning is the safe
    error and under-warning is not.

    This is NOT the inverse of :func:`is_direct_local_request`, which also
    requires loopback because it answers a different question ("is this the
