"""Shared pre-enqueue guard for Kiro-backed dashboard sessions.

Readiness is probed once at gateway start and then only on an explicit user
action (see ``kiro_prerequisite.KiroPrerequisiteService.session_ready``), so the
latched value can be arbitrarily stale. That splits the callers in two:

* **Ordinary sends are UNGATED.** A stale not-ready value must never block a
  send: the real ACP attempt is the authority, and it reports a signed-out CLI as
  an actionable ``AcpAuthRequired`` error in the chat transcript. Blocking on
  latched state was the stuck case — a user who signed in from a terminal stayed
  locked out until something re-probed. These handlers mutate nothing before the
  turn, so a failed turn costs only an error card.
* **Endpoints that act BEFORE the turn still BLOCK**
  (:func:`reject_if_kiro_unverified`) — the poll-driven ``kiro-cli`` spawn sites
  and the destructive reruns. Neither can rely on the ACP attempt as its
  authority: one has no turn at all, the other has already rewritten durable
  history by the time the turn fails. See
  ``docs/system-specs/modules/acp-client.md`` § "Poll-driven spawn sites are
  readiness-gated".

    """The request path, rendered so it cannot forge a log line.

    ``aiohttp``'s ``Request.path`` is URL-DECODED, so ``%0A`` in a path segment
    arrives as a real newline, and the dynamic-route pattern for ``{slot}``
    excludes only ``/{}`` — a newline matches it and reaches this gate. Logging
    that verbatim lets a caller append arbitrary lines to ``gateway.log``, which
    would defeat the entire reason the refusal is logged at all: the log is meant
    to be evidence, and forgeable evidence is worse than none.

    Scope of the threat, stated exactly, because the halves differ. Only
    U+000A/U+000D put a real byte ``0a``/``0d`` in the file, so only those forge a
    physical line there. ``%C2%85``/``%E2%80%A8``/``%E2%80%A9`` decode to
    U+0085/U+2028/U+2029, which are multi-byte UTF-8 and therefore leave the FILE
    one line — but they are ``str.splitlines()`` boundaries, so any Python consumer
    that re-splits the log sees the forged line, and a rendered view may break on
    them too. Invisible formatting characters forge nothing structurally and reorder
    what a human reads. Every route ends at the same place: a line the reader cannot
    trust.

    ``repr`` does the escaping rather than a hand-written character class, because a
    class narrow enough to write out is narrower than the threat. ``Cc``/``Cf``/``Zl``/
    ``Zp`` alone misses four categories that ``yarl``'s percent-decoding can deliver:
    ``%C2%A0`` and ``%E3%80%80`` are ``Zs``, ``%EE%80%80`` is ``Co``, ``%CD%B8`` is
    ``Cn``. ``str.__repr__`` escapes everything ``str.isprintable()`` rejects, which is
    all of those plus ``Cs``, and it takes that from the interpreter's own Unicode
    tables rather than from a list somebody has to remember to extend. ``Cs`` is not
    reachable here — ``yarl`` leaves an invalid escape like ``%ED%A0%80`` as literal
    text rather than decoding it to a lone surrogate — but it matters that ``repr``
    covers it anyway: a raw surrogate is a string a UTF-8 log handler cannot encode,
    and ``logging`` swallows handler errors, so the line would vanish. Losing the line
    is the one outcome this function exists to prevent.

    ESCAPED rather than rejected, unlike dev_fleet's ``reject_unsafe``: this runs
    on the fail-CLOSED branch, where raising would turn a correct 503 into a 500.
    Escaped rather than stripped, too — a caller who sent one of these is exactly
    what the reader wants to see, so the evidence is preserved, just rendered inert.
    Visible non-ASCII survives (``repr`` escapes only the unprintable), so a path is
    not ASCII-folded for the operators most likely to need to read it. The quotes
    ``repr`` adds are wanted: they delimit the value, so trailing whitespace or an
    empty path is visible instead of blending into the message. Non-``str``
    (attribute absent, or a request-like double) degrades to the placeholder for the
    same no-raise reason.

    reader who greps the log for that endpoint and finds nothing concludes it is
    healthy. A silent refusal here therefore inverts the diagnosis rather than merely
    withholding it. An absent line gets read as evidence; it is not. So the refusal
    must be visible.

    It must ALSO not be visible 570 times an hour. A signed-out gateway with an open
    dashboard polls ``/api/models`` every 8s and ``/api/sessions/usage`` every 30s,
    and every one of those refuses HERE — the sibling branches that log in
    ``api_models`` sit BELOW this gate (``agents.py:1014`` onward vs the gate at
    ``:942``) and are never reached in that state, so one line per refused request is

    hours, evicting the genuine diagnostics an operator came to read. A line meant to
    make the log trustworthy must not be the thing that empties it.

    One line per outage is the honest amount: the condition reported is
    gateway-global ("the CLI is not verified ready"), not per-endpoint, so the flag

    Two classes qualify, both because the ACP attempt cannot be their authority:

    * **Poll-driven ``kiro-cli`` spawn sites** (``/api/models``,
      ``/api/sessions/usage``) — they shell out on a timer with no turn to report
      into, and an unauthenticated spawn opens an interactive browser login (and
      ``kiro-cli chat`` hangs) on every poll interval.
    * **Destructive reruns** (regenerate, edit-resend, rewind) — they truncate
      and PERSIST session history *before* the background turn starts, so a
      signed-out install would drop prior turns while returning 200. There is no
      later error card that can undo a durable rewrite, so the check has to
      happen before the mutation.
    * **``POST /v1/chat/completions``** — no transcript the caller reads. Its
      collectors take only ``chunk``/``assistant`` roles, so an ``AcpAuthRequired``
      turn's ``error`` card is invisible and the request would answer 200 with
      empty content, which an SDK client cannot tell apart from a model that said
      nothing.

    Ordinary sends are deliberately NOT gated: they mutate nothing up front, so a
    stale latch must not block them (see the module docstring). That includes
    ``POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/continue``, which only queues a synthetic
    continuation for the runner to dispatch — it is a send with a machine-written
    body, not a fourth class. A missing or invalid service fails closed here.

    These callers must not trust the latch in EITHER direction, so this uses
    :func:`kiro_verified_ready` — a stale ``ready=True`` is as dangerous as a
    stale ``ready=False`` here (it authorizes the history rewrite or the
    browser-opening spawn), and only these paths pay for the re-probe.
