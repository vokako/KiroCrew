"""Cloud provisioning API handlers — owner-only, user-initiated launch control.

Backs the ``/api/cloud/*`` routes that let the dashboard provision a Kiro Crew
instance in the user's own AWS account (the same flow as ``kirocrew cloud`` in a
terminal, driven as a durable background job — see :mod:`cloud.launch_job`).

Like the instances control plane, every route is **owner-only, never reachable
via Slack**, and emits a SEL audit event. Provisioning is a deliberate
**human/installer action** (the owner clicking Launch is the consent), which is
exactly the caller ``cloud.aws.assert_human_action`` permits — the gateway
process carries no ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY``, so the destructive verbs
(stop/start/destroy) are allowed here but blocked from any agent subprocess.

POSIX-only: the deploy engine shells to ``bash``/``aws``; Windows returns 400.
The exception is the two read-only launch-history routes, which parse a local
job store and shell to nothing — they answer on every platform so a Windows
dashboard can still render its Remote Crew list (see :func:`_guard`).
No new AWS logic lives here — it reuses the tested ``cloud/`` engine.
