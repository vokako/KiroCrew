    lived only there would leave the dashboard — the surface carrying most of the

    defensively because a turn can complete without one (an errored turn's
    ``usage`` may be absent), and ``emit_turn_usage`` drops non-positive values.

    maps it back to the canonical key ONLY for ``claude_code`` (the canonical-

    the model an auto-created slot runs on is the model the chip says it will.
    Before this the chat-send path only consulted the crew's own pin

    but not run by the first turn of a fresh slot until the gateway restarted.

    The value is deliberately a LOCAL for the ``get_or_create`` call and is

    picker-list membership, and a consumer must be able to tell "the account
    cannot run this" from "nothing has told us yet". Every fail-open branch
    below is a genuine unknown, not a runnable answer:

    * no pin, or the ``auto`` sentinel -- nothing to judge;
    * ``claude_code`` / the claude backend -- ``slot.model`` holds a canonical
      key (or a prefixed provider id) against BARE advertised ids, and comparing
      those two namespaces would call every legitimate model unusable (see
      :func:`model_is_unusable`'s namespace note);
    * a provider with no ``available_models`` getter, or one that raised;
    * an empty advertised set -- no session yet, or a backend that omits
      ``models``. :func:`model_is_unusable` folds this into "allow the send",
      which is the right call for the WIRE; for a DISPLAYED verdict it has to
      stay distinguishable from an entitled answer, so it is caught here.

    ``providers.acp`` withholds an inherited/persisted model the account is not
    entitled to and leaves the session on the backend default, so the turn
    succeeds -- but nothing told the user, and the composer chip plus the picker
    went on reporting a model no turn would ever use (observed after a plan
    downgrade: the chip still read ``claude-opus-5`` while every turn ran on
    auto). This is the read side of that withhold, using the SAME predicate and
    the SAME namespace fold (:func:`resolve_pin_spelling`) the wire sites use,
    so the two cannot disagree about what "usable" means.

    A ``True`` verdict is REPORTED, never acted on: the caller does not clear the
    pin. The withhold already keeps the model off the wire, so a stale pin is
    inert and recovers by itself if entitlement returns.

    A pin can carry a stale ``<namespace>::<bare-id>`` qualifier from the
    catalog that advertised it when it was stored, while the session being
    judged advertises the BARE id (#8521) -- the same class of namespace

    both, so an older open banner is unredeemable by anyone — clicking it walks
    the user through a full provider login and lands them on a bare
    ``http://127.0.0.1:<dead-port>/?code=…`` page that looks like success and
    consumes nothing.

    ``oauth_url`` is POPPED rather than merely flagged around, so a client that

    the render layers all gate on having a URL. This mirrors the vocabulary the

    Membership is an ownership FACT, not a decision about what the user sees: it
    only tells the caller that a card surface drives this server's consent flow,
    so a request for it can be tagged ``card_owned`` and the render layer given
    something to act on. Nothing here suppresses anything.

    Two conditions, both required, each consumed from the facility that already
    decides it rather than re-derived here:

    * :func:`kirocrew_managed_names` -- our own MCP store wrote the entry. This is
      the single ownership discriminator, shared with the agent-spec emit path and
      the config-sync gate, so ownership means one thing everywhere.
    * :func:`get_visible_providers` -- the name is a Connections provider with a
      rendered card. Connect keys the store by provider slug and the card reads it
      back by slug, so the slug is the join between the two.

    Ownership ALONE is not enough. The dashboard's add-custom-server API writes to
    the same store, so a hand-added remote is every bit as "ours" while having no
    card anywhere. A provider whose launch gate is closed has no card either.
    Requiring a card keeps the annotation on servers that genuinely have a second
    surface, so the render layer never has to second-guess it.

    Registry slugs are slash-free, so ``mcp_server_alias`` is the identity on this
    set and kiro-cli's ``serverName`` is the slug verbatim -- no alias widening is
    needed. What remains open is an exact-slug collision: a server hand-added
    under a real slug is annotated, though it still renders on that provider's
    card, so a surface survives.

    Does blocking file I/O (store read + registry read) -- callers on the event
    loop must hand it to a worker thread.

    FAILS OPEN to the empty set on any error: nothing is annotated and every
    surface renders every banner, which is exactly today's behavior.

    id is not their user id. The session KEY carries it: the canonical grammar is
    ``{surface}:{agent}:{chat_type}:{scope…}`` and for a 1:1 DM the scope is exactly
    the peer's platform id. Parsing goes through ``messaging.link.parse_session_key``
    because that module is the ONE canonical address parser (RFC §9 rule 4); a second
    decomposition here would drift from the grammar the keys are built with.

    Derived from the KEY ALONE, deliberately. Two other records name a peer and
    neither is safe here, because a principal is only usable if it describes the
    conversation the link points at:

    * the session's stored channel value (``{namespace}:{user_id}``) is written ONCE,
      when the session is created, while the origin/mirror link is rewritten on
      later turns. Under a ``unified`` bucket -- which collapses several peers' 1:1
      DMs into one session on purpose -- the two therefore drift: the attribution can
      name the peer who created the session while the link points at a different
      peer's conversation. Authorizing against it would check the wrong person and
      pass, which is worse than declining to name one.
    * a **forum or group** scope is ``(chat_id, thread_id)``, so its audience is a
      room and no single principal owns it. Returning ``scope[0]`` would hand a
      supergroup id to a check that tests USER rosters.

    Empty therefore means "the key does not name one principal", never "no principal
    is authorized". A transport whose other rosters can still judge the route (a
    Discord thread against its thread allow-list) uses them; one with nothing left to
    consult refuses, because this feeds a network egress boundary.

    the tag (per-chunk in the run loop, or a finalizing re-redact), the artifact
    is already in the text by the time this runs. The wire-stream redactors are
    deliberately not in that list: they rewrite only what crosses WS/SSE, and
    ``assistant_text`` is accumulated independently of them.

    Tell the user the text was altered. Without this the rewrite is silent: the
    redactors' warnings are logged and nothing else, so a user copies a command
    whose credential has become a placeholder or whose URL has been rewritten
    and only finds out when it fails downstream.

    The counts come from the TAGS in the persisted text, not from the redactors'
    returned warnings, because on the streaming path those warning lists are
    almost always empty here: the run loop redacts every chunk before it enters
    ``assistant_text``, so a finalizing re-redact re-redacts already-clean text
    and reports nothing. Warnings only fire for a secret or URL split across
    chunk boundaries, the rarer case. Reading the artifact instead of the event
    answers the question the user actually has -- "is what I am about to copy
    still what the assistant wrote?" -- and stays correct wherever the
    substitution happened.

    The counts sum every tag the redactors can emit: every CREDENTIAL tag, read
    from ``CREDENTIAL_REDACTION_TAGS`` which the security package owns beside
    the passes that write them, plus the exfiltration-URL tag, counted by
    ``EXFILTRATION_REDACTION_TAG_PREFIX`` prefix because that tag interpolates
    the redacted domain and so has no constant form to equality-compare (the
    substitution is built FROM the exported prefix, so the two cannot drift).
    Enumerating tags by hand here is what would leave an
    encoded-credential-only segment silently rewritten and undercounted a mixed

    the message renders is invisible to the user, whereas awaiting it would add
    store latency to every segment flush of every turn. Failures are logged by
    the callee and never surface into the turn.

    Spawned via ``asyncio.create_task`` (not ``loop.create_task``) to match every
    other detached task in this module — tests that neutralize background work
    patch ``chat_runner.asyncio.create_task``, and a task spawned off the loop
    handle directly would slip past that and run real store I/O mid-test.

    The no-running-loop case is guarded: with no loop, registration is skipped
    rather than raising into a segment flush (some callers in this module's
    history are sync, and a CLI/test path has no artifact-store expectations).

    **Restricted sessions never register.** Incognito / temporary slots
    (``slot.is_restricted``) are denied every artifact write at the HTTP gate
    (``_is_restricted_session``), so registering here would be a back door around
    that ceiling: widget HTML from a session the user expected to leave no trace
    would persist to ``artifacts/<slug>/`` and show up in the library. The gate
    keys off the SAME ``slot.is_restricted`` signal, so the two agree by

    """Apply a deferred session reset queued on *slot*, if any.

    Returns whether a teardown actually ran, so a caller can decide whether a
    respawn is owed. A deferral left armed returns False.

    Two independent deferrals share this consumer, and both are queued rather
    than applied inline because their producer runs INSIDE the turn they would
    tear down: a project change (set_project) and a conversation discard
    (reset_conversation).

    They are not alternatives and neither subsumes the other, so when both are
    eligible both run, project change first. ``reset`` recreates the session but
    leaves replay suppression alone, so a discard that asked for
    ``replay=False`` still has to run to suppress the ``[CONVERSATION HISTORY]``
    rebuild — dropping it because a reset had already torn the session down
    would hand the next turn a reconstruction of the conversation the caller
    discarded.

    ``allow_discard`` IS THE BOUNDARY, and only the end-of-turn caller sets it.
    The project reset is consumed at three points including the one just before
    ``get_or_create``, and that pre-acquire point is safe for it only in the
    narrow sense its own comment claims: no lock is held by THIS turn, so
    ``reset`` cannot self-kill. It says nothing about another actor on the same
    session — a channel (Slack, Discord) turn runs on the linked session with no
    dashboard task at all, so a discard consumed there tears the provider down
    under a channel response that is still streaming and the reply is lost. The
    discard therefore waits for the end of a turn, where the session is between
    turns rather than about to start one.

    Even there the boundary is checked atomically, not assumed: the discard goes
    through ``discard_conversation(..., skip_if_busy=True)``, which refuses under
    the same session lock that pops the session. Probing from here and tearing
    down afterwards would leave a window between the two — long enough for a
    channel message to acquire the session's semaphore and begin streaming a
    reply the teardown would then destroy. The semaphore is also a stricter
    signal than ``has_active_turn``, which cannot see a turn that holds the
    semaphore but has not yet put a prompt in flight.

    The discard additionally waits on sub-agent children.
    ``discard_conversation`` releases the shared runtime those children run on,
    and turn end is exactly when they are most likely to outlive their parent:
    ``slot.running`` is already False while they keep going, and the last child
    can still have a ``[Subagent completion event]`` injection in flight. So a
    slot with attached children leaves the flag ARMED and the discard lands at a
    later consume instead — the caller waits, the child's work survives. That is
    the same policy the immediate route enforces as a 409, applied through the
    same shared predicate rather than a second copy of the probes.

    Each flag is cleared only after its own effect succeeds, and compare-and-
    cleared so a key queued by a concurrent producer during the await is not
    clobbered.

    """Open the retention window on a drained completion once its turn has RUN.

    The gateway records the owed agent ids on the slot when it has to QUEUE a
    sub-agent completion (``KiroCrewGateway._defer_queued_delivery``), keyed on the
    announce content, which is what keeps each ``result.txt`` alive for as long as
    the row waits. This is the other half — but it deliberately does not fire at
    dispatch.

    A ``delivered`` tombstone is durable and excludes the folder from restart
    orphan reconciliation, while a dispatched turn is not yet durable: the
    injected row is still being persisted and the model has not necessarily
    consumed the prompt. Writing the tombstone at dispatch would mean a crash in
    that window loses the completion for good (no queue row left, no folder to
    recover, and the result pruned one TTL later). Waiting for the task to finish
    makes the failure mode fail-safe instead: nothing is written, so the next
    start's reconciliation still sees the folder and re-delivers it.

    Nothing is settled until the model has CONSUMED the prompt, and that is the
    only condition. ``_run_chat`` handles a signed-out CLI, a dead provider,
    exhausted prompt-busy retries, a transient backend error and a stall by
    rendering a card and RETURNING NORMALLY, several of them after re-queueing the
    prompt itself for a later retry — so the task's outcome says nothing either way.
    *consumed* is the evidence that does: ``_run_chat`` sets it on the provider's
    turn-complete event for a real end-of-turn, or earlier on the first streamed
    token or fired tool call. Those triggers are exactly the states in which the
    announce will NOT be replayed. An EMPTY response splits: the FIRST one
    re-queues this same announce verbatim and RETRACTS the report, so the clock
    waits for the replay that lands; the second re-queues a continuation instead
    and stays consumed.

    Consumption is one-way, so a turn cancelled or failed after it still settles:
    the result is in the model's context either way, and withholding the tombstone
    would have the next start re-announce a completion the parent already read.

    *consumed* is a cell owned by THIS armed turn, never slot-wide state: a turn's
    tail-drain starts its successor before the predecessor's callback runs, so a
    shared field would be reset by the successor and leave the earlier — already
    consumed — completion unsettled and re-injected after a restart.

    An unconsumed turn settles nothing, which is the fail-safe side: the folder
    survives for the replay to read and the next start's reconciliation recovers
    it, where a premature tombstone would have the reaper delete a result the
    parent never saw.

    decide "did the USER intervene". A background cron notification or sub-agent
    completion queued mid-turn is orchestration, not a user "don't do that", so it
    must NOT block or purge a pending recovery (#2696 GPT round; the R20 fix).

    Classification is PURELY STRUCTURAL — the `kind` tag stamped at enqueue, never
    the message text. `is_system_injection_item` covers the three orchestration
    kinds (`CRON_NOTIFICATION_KIND`, `SUBAGENT_COMPLETION_KIND`,
    `SYNTHETIC_RECOVERY_KIND`); `is_synthetic_payload_item` additionally covers a
    recovery entry that replays runner-authored text. There is deliberately NO
    content match: the earlier `CRON_NOTIFY_RE.match` / prefix test was
    prefix-anchored and therefore spoofable — a user could queue
    `[Cron notification from "x"]\ndon't delete it` during a promise-only turn and
    have their intervention silently ignored while the announced action dispatched
    anyway. A user message carries no enqueue tag, so it now correctly counts as a
    user follow-up and aborts the pending recovery; real cron / sub-agent events
    are tagged at their injection sites and stay excluded (#2696 GPT round,

    Authorization is decided when a prompt is ADMITTED (`authorize_target` for
    `session_send`, the authenticated composer for a human typing into a busy
    session), but delivery happens later, at this drain — and the target-side
    containment those decisions rest on can change in between: a target
    authorized while unlinked can be given a channel or mirror link before its
    queue drains, and the queued prompt would then execute and republish to an
    audience its admission never contemplated.

    Producers of plain (user-speech) entries stamp the containment snapshot at
    enqueue (`session_control.containment_meta`); this sweep recomputes the same
    constraints and drops any entry for which a constraint holds NOW that did
    not hold at admission — including a WORKSPACE change, which swaps the
    memory/lessons/project context under a waiting prompt. An unmarked plain
    entry fails closed against the boolean constraint set, so an untagged
    producer can never ride a queued prompt past a boundary the tagged paths
    respect.

    Entries carrying `_directive_user_origin` (authenticated-human provenance)
    are exempt from the LINKED constraint only: the author typed into the
    session's own surface and linking it is that owner's deliberate act, so
    composer input into a just-linked session is designed behaviour. A NEW
    outbound mirror still drops them — the author does not control mirror
    links — as do all other constraints (see
    `session_control.newly_held_constraints`).

    Structural exemption is narrow: cron notifications and sub-agent
    completions only (`CRON_NOTIFICATION_KIND` / `SUBAGENT_COMPLETION_KIND`) —
    runner machinery minted fresh by trusted internal producers, which
    channel-born sessions receive by design. Synthetic-recovery entries are
    NOT exempt: a recovery replays externally admitted content verbatim, so it
    is re-validated like any plain entry against the admission stamp its
    requeue recorded (`_queue_recovery`), failing closed when unmarked.

    Runs at the top of the drain with no suspension point between the snapshot
    and the dequeue (everything below is synchronous on the event loop), so the
    decision cannot go stale before the surviving entry becomes a turn. A drop
    is never silent: the queue card is retracted, a visible notice naming the
    changed constraint lands in the transcript, and the drop is written to the
    SEL.
