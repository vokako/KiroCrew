"""Persistent HMAC signing secret for dashboard auth tokens.

Extracted from ``token_auth.py`` so both the token-auth module and the
refresh-token module can import the secret without creating a circular
dependency between them. The secret is shared across both modules.

The secret is stored at ``<config_dir>/token_signing.key`` (owner-only
0600). Persistence is required for correctness: tokens and session
cookies are HMAC-signed with this key, so a fresh random secret on every
process start would invalidate every outstanding Slack link and cookie,
locking users out after any gateway restart.

Loading is LAZY (``_get_secret()``), NOT a module-level call: merely
*importing* this module must not write ``token_signing.key`` into
``$KIROCREW_HOME``. The CLI imports token_auth (and thus this module)
transitively for every ``kirocrew`` subcommand, so an import-time write
(a) breaks ``gateway --seed`` — which requires an empty target home and
refuses a non-empty one — and (b) pollutes the home for read-only
commands like ``kirocrew --help``.

    """Return the HMAC signing secret, persisted across restarts.

    See module docstring for the persistence rationale. Falls back to an
    ephemeral secret if the key file is unwritable — tokens still work within
    this process; they just won't survive a restart (the pre-existing
    behaviour).

    Cross-process atomicity of key *creation* is the crux here. Multiple
    first-time gateways sharing one data home (``warm_auth_singletons()`` warms
    this before the port bind, so two racing boots can both observe the key as
    absent) MUST converge on a SINGLE key. A plain last-writer-wins write —
    even an atomic temp-file + rename — is NOT sufficient: each process would
    generate its own key, one file would survive on disk, and the loser would
    keep an in-memory key that no longer matches the persisted file, silently
    corrupting every token it issues for sibling instances / after a restart.

    The fix: only ONE key may ever be created, and it is only ever PUBLISHED
    whole. The fresh key is staged into a private sibling file (the shared
    :func:`kiro_crew.atomic_write.atomic_write` helper -- owner-only before the
    first byte, fsynced, cleaned up on failure) and then linked into place with
    ``os.link``. The link is atomic and non-clobbering: exactly one process
    wins, and every other process takes the ``FileExistsError`` branch and READS
    the winner's bytes instead of generating its own.

    ``os.link`` rather than ``os.replace`` is what keeps the single-creator
    election -- a last-writer-wins rename would let each racer install its own
    key, leaving the losers signing with bytes no longer on disk. Staging rather
    than creating in place is what keeps the destination name from ever
    resolving to a partial file: creating it empty and writing afterwards means
    a kill in between (an update completing during shutdown, a reboot) persists
    a 0-byte key, and because the fast-path read then sees <32 bytes forever,
    every later boot degrades to an ephemeral secret -- a dashboard that loads
    while every signed action fails, which a restart cannot fix.

    A small bounded retry loop still covers the publish-then-read interleaving.
