    The cron executor resets its agent session the moment the run finishes, so
    by the time the user opens the injected ``cron-{id}`` slot there is no
    resident provider for the slot-detail open path to read and no snapshot
    either — ``broadcast_context_usage`` (the meter's single writer) is only
    reached by dashboard-driven turns. The bar therefore rendered 0% for a
    session with a full transcript. This helper captures the reading while the
    provider is still alive; :func:`inject_cron_result_to_dashboard` routes it
    through the single writer so the open path serves it like any other
    cold-session snapshot.

    Mirrors ``chat_runner._context_usage_payload``'s accessor discipline: the
    provider's PUBLIC accessors only (``last_prompt_stats`` lives on the inner
    AcpClient and would always miss on the pooled provider), and token counts
    ship only when both are measured — ``used == 0`` means "not measured", and
    asserting a false "0 / W tokens" is worse than omitting the pair.

    Returns ``None`` when nothing was measured (``pct <= 0``): a provider that
    just ran a turn always occupies context (the prompt itself), so a
    zero/absent pct here means "not reported", never "measured empty" — the
    same contract as ``_context_reading`` on the read side. Skipping the write
    also deliberately preserves an earlier run's real snapshot rather than
    overwriting it with an unmeasured zero (which would recreate the 0%-bar
    symptom this helper exists to fix); the genuine post-compaction 0% reset
    frame is emitted by the session manager's compact callback for live
    sessions, not by this capture path. Never raises — this feeds best-effort
    display state and must not fail the cron delivery that calls it.

#: resolving that would get whatever the instruction is NOW, which is the same
#: misattribution that makes ``/to-chat`` pass ``include_prompt=False``.
#:
#: "the nearest row above that carries one" rather than "the row above", because
#: in the steady state the row directly above is another reference. What the
#: sentence promises is exactly what :func:`_prompt_already_recorded` enforces: a
#: verbatim copy within :data:`_PROMPT_LOOKBACK_ROWS` rows, so following the
#: pointer terminates.
_UNCHANGED_PROMPT_BODY = (

#: instruction. It rides in the header's protected marker block -- immediately
#: after the run marker, ahead of the body separator -- so it can never be
#: confused with body text, exactly as the run marker cannot (see
#: :func:`_parse_prompt_row`).
#:
#: Reference-ness MUST be a structural fact of how the row was written, never an
#: inference from what the body renders as. The body of a reference is the human
#: prose :data:`_UNCHANGED_PROMPT_BODY`, and a real instruction can equal that
#: prose (a job whose ``message`` literally is that sentence) or quote this token
#: in its own text. Deciding "is this a reference?" from the body would then read
#: a genuine instruction row as a pointer, skip it as the latest antecedent, and
#: attribute a later identical run to the row above it -- the run-attribution
#: corruption this whole path exists to prevent. Keyed off the marker instead,
#: the two are independent: a verbatim row is compared on its real bytes however
#: they read, and a reference is recognised however its prose reads.
_REFERENCE_MARKER = "<!-- cron-ref -->"

#: Shortest instruction worth referencing instead of storing again.
#:
#: A reference is not free: the row keeps its header, stamp and marker either way,
#: so replacing the text costs ``len(_UNCHANGED_PROMPT_BODY)`` and saves
#: ``len(prompt)``. Below break-even the transcript gets BIGGER *and* loses the
#: instruction -- the worst of both -- and most crons in the wild carry a one-line
#: message ("check pipeline health"), so the common case must be left alone. The
#: threshold sits well above break-even rather than at it: a 100-char message
#: repeated across a full 200-row window costs ~20KB against a 10MB rotation
#: budget, which is not worth trading the text for. The saving only becomes worth
#: the indirection at the kilobyte-prompt scale.
_MIN_PROMPT_CHARS_TO_REFERENCE = 500

#: How far back a reference may reach for its antecedent, in ROWS of the tab.
#: A run writes two rows, so this is ~20 runs.
#:
#: The bound is what makes a reference RESOLVABLE rather than merely true. Three
#: windows disagree about what "still here" means: the live slot keeps 10,000 rows
#: (``state._MAX_SLOT_MESSAGES``), the durable transcript keeps ~200 lines
#: (``history._SESSION_KEEP_LINES``, tail), and the replay a follow-up turn reads
#: is character-budgeted and tail-heavy (``context._REPLAY_BUDGET_CHARS``). An
#: unbounded scan reads the largest of the three, so a copy that rotation has
#: already dropped from disk keeps satisfying it -- the instruction would be stored
#: once and referenced forever, with the text nowhere a reader can reach. Bounding
#: the look-back re-anchors a verbatim copy every ~20 runs instead, which is inside
#: the two ROW-counted windows (the 10,000-row slot and the ~200-line transcript
#: tail) and cannot be defeated by a long-lived gateway.
#:
#: It does NOT promise resolvability inside the replay: that window is counted in
#: CHARACTERS, so ~20 runs whose RESULTS are long can exhaust the budget before it
#: reaches the antecedent, leaving a reference whose text is on disk but outside
#: what one replay shows. No write-time row count can close that -- the budget is
#: scaled at REPLAY time by the active model's context window, which the writing
#: run cannot know and which can change between the write and the read. Closing it
#: belongs on the READING side (have the replay builder resolve a marker it can
#: see); a row count is the conservative invariant available here, and it errs
#: toward re-anchoring too often rather than too rarely.

    result is recorded, while the row that must act on it is written by a
    different component that may not run at all: ``hide_in_chat`` and
    ``persistent_session=False`` both skip this injection entirely, so a hidden
    run of an edited message would spend the signal, and the next visible run
    would reference a surviving row still holding the OLD instruction -- a
    transcript that attributes a result to something the run was never asked.
    Reading the rows cannot desync from them.

    It is deliberately the LATEST instruction-bearing prompt row that is compared,
    not any row in reach. An edit that is later reverted (A, then B, then A again)
    would satisfy an ``any()`` scan against the old A row while the run above
    actually carries B -- so the placeholder would assert "same as the previous
    run" about a different instruction, which is the exact misattribution this
    design exists to avoid. Comparing the latest one makes the sentence true by
    construction, and reverts write A again.

    Equality, not containment: a substring test would find a newly shortened
    "do X" inside a stored "do X and Y" and suppress a genuine change.

    Bounded by :data:`_PROMPT_LOOKBACK_ROWS`, which is what keeps a reference
    resolvable rather than merely accurate -- see that constant for the three
    disagreeing windows and why an unbounded scan strands the instruction off
    disk. Reaching the end of the look-back without an instruction-bearing row is
    the ordinary re-anchor path, not an error: the run writes the text again.

    Skipped entirely for a prompt shorter than
    :data:`_MIN_PROMPT_CHARS_TO_REFERENCE`, where a reference would cost more
    bytes than it saves.

    Reads ``slot.messages``, the live window: freshly hydrated from the transcript
    on a first bind, and carrying this process's appended rows afterwards. The
    ``history`` parameter is NOT usable here -- :func:`prefetch_cron_history`
    returns ``None`` once the slot is linked, which is every run of a persistent
    cron after the first, so a scan of it would see nothing exactly when the
    answer matters. Only ``user`` rows are considered, because only a run's prompt
    row is evidence of what a run was given; a row a person typed in the tab is
    not, however it is headed.

    ``own_marker`` -- this run's own :func:`run_marker` -- excludes the run asking
    the question. Injecting one run twice must render the SAME bytes, or the two
    rows dedup to neither and the tab grows: a scan counting this run's own
    earlier row as precedent would make the second call write a reference where
    the first wrote the instruction. No production caller injects one run twice
    with ``include_prompt=True`` today (``/to-chat`` re-surfaces the result alone),
    so this is an invariant the dedup layers rely on rather than a live path --
    which is why it is pinned by tests rather than left to be rediscovered.

    A run with no marker gets no suppression at all (``own_marker`` empty, which
    :func:`run_marker` returns for a job carrying no timestamp). Without a run
    identity there is nothing to tell "the row I just wrote" from "a row a

    linked, whichever path did it.

    Writes the run as a PAIR: the job's own prompt as a ``user`` row, then the

    executor streams the prompt straight to the provider and never persists it,
    so without the user row a follow-up turn replays a stack of results with
    nothing saying what any of them was asked -- it cannot tell which run the
    person in front of it is answering. The pair is written only when the run produced a
    result, so neither row can appear without its counterpart.

    ``include_prompt`` is False for a caller that is RE-SURFACING an older
    result rather than delivering a fresh one (``/to-chat``). Only the run that
    produced the result knows the prompt that produced it: ``job.message`` is
    live configuration a user can edit afterwards, so a re-surfacing caller
    reading it would pair the stored output with an instruction that never ran.
    Such a caller writes the result row alone -- the pre-existing behaviour --
    and any prompt row the executor already wrote is still in the history it
    hydrates from.

    ``context_reading`` is the run's context-meter reading captured by
    :func:`context_meter_reading` while the cron's provider was still resident.
    When present it is routed through ``broadcast_context_usage`` — the meter's
    single writer — so an open tab updates live and the slot-detail open path

        independent appends -- they can land out of order, or one can fail
        alone, leaving the replay with a reversed or half-written run that no
        timestamp ordering repairs. ``append_rows_if_absent_off_loop`` holds
        ``atomic_appends`` for the group, which is the contract's stated
        companion for a multi-append caller that offloads.

        Each row keeps ``append_if_absent``'s idempotence, so the duplicate
        check and the write stay one critical section per row: an unlocked
        read_messages() + append would leave a TOCTOU window in which a
        concurrent slot save (or a cron re-fire) lands the identical row between
        the check and the write. Best-effort -- lock/IO errors only skip the
        durable copy, which the slot above already carries.

    for a brand-new job's FIRST run: session-control caller identity resolves
    through the live slot table (``caller_slot_key`` matches the presented
    ``cron:{job_id}`` against each slot's link), so without this pre-create every

    has the same first-run dependency for sub-agent event routing, completion
    injection, and widget/question/approval delivery. From the second run onward
    the previous delivery's slot covers all of it.

    and the hydration must move together — see :func:`_bind_cron_slot`. The
