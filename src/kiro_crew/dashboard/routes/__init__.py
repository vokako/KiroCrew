"""The dashboard's HTTP route table, split into ordered slices.

Every registration lives here rather than inline in ``start_dashboard``: one
module per section of the table, each exposing ``register(app)``.

**The order of ``_REGISTRARS`` is load-bearing and must not be sorted.** aiohttp
resolves a request against its routes in REGISTRATION order, and this table
depends on that in several places -- a literal path is deliberately registered
before a pattern that would otherwise swallow it (``/api/skills/-/tree`` before
``/api/skills/{name:.+}``, ``/api/chat/slots/cleanup`` before
``/api/chat/slots/{slot}``, ``/api/steering/search`` before
``/api/steering/{key}``, and others called out in the slice comments). The slices
are contiguous and called in sequence, so global ordering holds by construction;
reordering this tuple, or the lines inside any slice, can silently shadow a
route.

``test_dashboard_route_table.py`` pins the resulting (method, path, handler)
sequence, so a reordering shows up as a failing test rather than as a 404 or a
handler quietly answering the wrong path.
