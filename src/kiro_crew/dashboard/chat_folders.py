    (429, a retryable capacity refusal, not a plain 400), so a caller must be

    """Validate one folder and append it to the store under the folders lock.

    The single create path. Callers that build folders for the user — the folder
    API below, project scaffolding — go through here, so none of them can end up
    with weaker path validation, a dangling ``parent_id``, weaker app-ownership
    isolation, or an unserialized store write than the others get. What stays
    with the caller is what differs between them: the response shape, the audit
    entry, and when to push a slots update (once per folder for a single create,
    once for a whole scaffold).

    ``request_app`` is the calling app's identity (empty when a person is
    calling): it is stamped as ``owner_app`` and gates nesting under folders
    other apps own. Never taken from a request body — a caller that could name
    its own owner could name someone else's (see ``_folder_owner_app``).

    ``tags`` is a shape-checked list of tag ids the caller wants copied onto
    every new chat filed into this folder (the folder API validates the request
    shape and answers 400 ``tags_invalid`` itself). The AUTHORITATIVE vocabulary
    intersection still runs here, under ``tags_write_lock``, at the point of
    application — the invariant every tag consumer follows (see
    api_chat_slot_tags / the channel filing): a tag deletion committing between
    the caller's shape check and this write must not be persisted onto the new
    folder, and the strip pass a deletion runs cannot see a folder that is not
    yet in the store. Included in the folder dict only when the intersection is
    non-empty — the same optional-key shape as ``color``, so a tagless folder
    keeps the record it has on disk today.

    Returns:
        The created folder, exactly as it was appended to the store.

    ``unique_project_dir`` makes "one folder per directory" atomic: the check
    runs inside the locked append, so two concurrent creators of the same
    ``project_dir`` cannot both observe it absent and both persist a folder —
    the loser is refused with code ``folder_project_dir_exists`` and can read
    the winner's folder after the fact. Off by default because the folder API
    has always allowed a person to point two folders at one directory by hand;
    only a caller whose own contract is "additive, skip what exists" (the
    scaffold) opts in.

    ``require_resolved_project_dir`` refuses a ``project_dir`` whose validation
    resolves to a different path than the caller named (code
    ``folder_project_dir_moved``). A caller that sets it is asserting its input
    is already canonical — the scaffold passes paths its scan just resolved and
    walked, so a resolution that lands elsewhere means a path component was
    swapped (typically for a symlink) between the scan and this create, and
    persisting the resolved target would bind the folder to a directory the
    scan never confirmed. Off by default because the folder API proper accepts
    ``~`` and symlinked paths from a person by design; resolution moving those
    is the feature, not an attack.

    Raises:
        FolderCreateError: if the folder was refused (unusable name, missing
            parent, unusable ``project_dir``, unknown color, or a
            ``unique_project_dir`` collision).
