    The titling call is tool-free by contract (``run_bg_oneliner`` rejects every
    permission request), so a message containing a URL can make the model
    narrate the denial instead of naming the chat — and that narration was being
    persisted as the session title. Prompt wording alone cannot guarantee the
    shape of a generation, so the reply is also validated here and treated as
    SKIP when it fails, which routes to the existing fallback title.

    Four signals, each independently sufficient:

    - a refusal/narration opener (see ``_TITLE_PROSE_OPENERS``);
    - more words than any real title carries;
    - more unspaced-script characters than any real title carries. Chinese,
      Japanese and Thai put no spaces between words, so a whole sentence in them
      is ONE word by ``str.split`` and slips past the word ceiling entirely;
    - sentence-terminating punctuation with text after it. The ASCII terminator
      must be followed by whitespace so "Node.js upgrade plan" and "Ship v1.2 to
      prod" stay valid; the full-width forms must not, because the scripts that
      use them do not space after punctuation.

    Known false negative: a SHORT refusal in an unspaced script with no
    terminator ("无法访问该链接") clears every ceiling and lands as the title.
    That class is inherent to matching prose by shape — the openers list is the
    only signal that catches it, and maintaining one per shipped locale is
    whack-a-mole. It fails to a wrong-but-short name, never to a paragraph.

    """Background task: re-examine an AUTO title as the conversation evolves.

    The initial title is generated from the first message, before the session's
    real task has emerged — so a long session's name often describes its
    opening pleasantry, and a session that fell back to the truncated first
    message keeps that truncation forever. Fired from ``chat_done`` (same
    call site as the initial titling), this re-runs the background ``_bg``
    one-liner at the ``_TITLE_REFRESH_MILESTONES`` user-turn marks and swaps
    the sidebar title when the model says the old one no longer fits.

    Token discipline (the whole point of doing this in the background instead
    of exposing a title tool to every chat):

    - Only ``title_origin == "auto"`` titles are ever refreshed. A manual
      rename is final; legacy titles with no stored origin rehydrate as "user"
      and are equally final.
    - Each milestone fires at most ONCE, attempt-counted: a KEEP/SKIP/prose
      reply or an error consumes it (no retries). Two milestones = at most two
      extra one-liner calls over a session's whole lifetime.
    - The consumed mark is persisted (``title_refresh_mark``) so a gateway
      restart cannot re-spend it.
    - The prompt is bounded exactly like the initial titling prompt (ten
      200-char lines) and offers a one-token KEEP reply for the common
      nothing-changed case.

    Never raises; concurrent attempts are excluded via ``_title_in_flight``. A
    manual rename landing mid-generation is detected via ``_title_epoch`` and
    the refresh stands down.
