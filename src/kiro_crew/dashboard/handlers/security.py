"""Denied-commands REST API — Settings > Security opt-out surface.

The 6 CRUD endpoints let a user disable/enable individual built-in denied
commands, disable them all at once, and add/remove their own patterns. Opt-out
state lives in the KEYSTONE file ``<config_dir>/denied_commands.json`` (on
``security._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`` — the agent cannot read OR write it), NOT in
the agent-readable ``config.json``. The file root IS the opt-out object:

    {
      "disable_all": false,
      "disabled_ids": ["<builtin-rule-id>", ...],
      "user_added": [{"id": "user-xxxx", "pattern": "rm -rf /tmp/mine",
                      "enabled": true, "note": "use a scoped path instead"}]
    }

``note`` is optional operator prose surfaced in the refusal when the rule fires,
so the caller reads remediation instead of a raw regex. It is metadata only: it
never participates in matching. Create-only, mirroring ``pattern`` — neither has
an edit endpoint; you delete the rule and re-add it.

Mutations run under the shared config lock, write atomically (owner-only
before the payload is published), and emit a SEL audit entry (``ok`` on
success, ``denied`` on reject). Governance
``commands``-scope pins force a built-in rule enabled even when the user disabled
it or set disable-all (tightest-wins): a pinned rule cannot be turned off (409)
and always counts as enabled in the snapshot.

All file I/O is offloaded to a thread executor (``build_denied_commands_snapshot_async``
+ ``_write_denied_state``) so the async handlers never block the gateway event
loop. Every endpoint (GET + all mutations) returns the full refreshed snapshot.

The module also hosts two adjacent Security-page surfaces: the read-only
governance policy viewer, and the per-app third-party trust grants
(``/api/security/trusted-apps``). Grants are the one write surface here that
targets the agent-writable ``config.json`` rather than the keystone file — see
the section comment for why that inversion is deliberate.

# Per-app third-party trust grants — Settings > Security opt-IN surface
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The narrow counterpart to ``agent.apps_allow_third_party``: instead of
# admitting every third-party app's code at once, the operator grants ONE named
# app at a time (``agent.apps_trusted``). ``apps.execution.trusted_app_names``
# is the enforcement reader; these 4 endpoints are the write surface.
#
# Unlike the denied-commands opt-out above, grants live in ``config.json`` rather
# than the keystone file. That is a deliberate call by the operator, but NOT
# because an agent needs to write them: measured, an agent can reach the grant
# through neither leg — ``is_sensitive_write_path(<home>/config.json)`` is True
# so its file-edit tool is blocked, and these routes sit in neither
# ``_STRICT_INTERNAL_API_PATHS`` nor ``_MIXED_INTERNAL_API_PATHS``, so
# ``token_auth`` default-denies an agent with ``Token required``. The reason is
# co-location: the blanket ``apps_allow_third_party`` this narrows already lives
# here, and splitting a control across two stores invites the two halves to
# disagree.
#
# Be precise about the blast radius: a grant is scoped to ONE named app as a
# DECISION, but the thing granted is not itself a bounded privilege — a trusted
# app's Python loads in-process in the gateway (``module_loader``), so it inherits
# the gateway's trust domain, including write access to the keystone files this
# module's doctrine keeps away from the agent. Adding per-app grants does not
# widen that (``apps_allow_third_party`` already reached it); it narrows WHO gets
# there. Every mutation is SEL-audited.

    ``mutate(agent_raw) -> None`` edits the RAW base ``agent`` dict in place.
    Runs under the SHARED config lock (the same lock every other config writer
    takes) so a concurrent agent/settings write cannot clobber the grant list,
    and the blocking read→write is offloaded to the default thread executor so a
    slow FS never stalls the gateway loop. The config cache is invalidated after
    the write, so the very next ``trusted_app_names()`` read sees the change —
    the grant enforces without a restart.

    **Why a targeted raw edit and not ``KiroCrewConfig.load()`` → ``save()``.**
    ``save()`` deliberately strips every value ``config.local.json`` also defines
    so overlay settings do not leak into the base file. Routing a trust mutation
    through it therefore rewrites the WHOLE base document minus all overlay-owned
    keys — so a user with base ``model: sonnet`` and overlay ``model: opus`` loses
    the base ``sonnet`` permanently the first time they grant an app trust. The
    effective config still reads ``opus`` from the overlay, so nothing looks
    wrong until the overlay is removed and the setting is simply gone. Editing
    only the key we own keeps the blast radius to that key. (The pre-existing
    overlay refusal below is a different guard, and still required: when the
    overlay owns a TRUST key, no base write can make the change effective.)

    Raises :class:`ConfigCorruptError` when ``config.json`` exists but does not
    parse as a JSON object. ``KiroCrewConfig.load()`` degrades a corrupt file to
    DEFAULTS, so a blind load→save here would write those defaults over the
    user's file and silently erase everything it holds — inline channel
    credentials, ``registries``, ``sandbox``/``jail``/``approval_mode``, the
    model. That is the same hazard ``_read_denied_strict`` guards for this
    module's sibling keystone file, and the reason its comment forbids the
    read-as-empty-and-write-back pattern. The pre-flight parse is inside the
    lock so a concurrent writer cannot slip a corrupt file in between the check
    and the load.

    Called on the FALLING edge of ``agent.apps_allow_third_party``. An app in this
    set was executing solely because the blanket flag admitted it, so withdrawing
    the flag has to stop it — otherwise the setting is a label that changes nothing
    until the next gateway restart.

    ``require_enabled`` selects which of the two passes this is, and the default is
    the security-relevant one:

    * ``False`` — the pass that runs BEFORE the flag is persisted. It ignores the
      recorded ``enabled`` flag entirely, because that flag is metadata rather than
      evidence about the runtime (``disable_app`` only writes it, and the CLI writes
      it from a process that cannot stop the gateway's backend child). Trusting it
      here skipped the sweep for exactly the apps whose recorded state was least
      trustworthy.
    * ``True`` — the bounded SECOND pass that runs after the write, whose only job
      is catching an app enabled DURING the window. It must stay narrow: the flag
      is already false by then, so an app's ``on_shutdown`` hook can no longer be
      loaded, and re-tearing-down an app the first pass already handled would run
      that hook in a state where the loader denies it.

    Apps WITH their own grant are left running: their permission is independent of
    the blanket flag, and stopping them would revoke a grant the user never touched.
    Builtins are never in scope — shipped code is exempt at the gate.

    Returns ``(stopped, still_running)``. Each app is torn down under its own
    lifecycle lock via the shared teardown, and one failure never aborts the rest —
    but a failure is REPORTED rather than swallowed, because an app that is still
    executing after the operator withdrew the trust admitting it is the single most

# profiles (Level 2 ``profiles/*.json``) are file-authored and deliberately
# un-editable via the UI (the agent cannot even read them — they sit on the
# sensitive-path keystone). This surface lets an operator SEE the resolved
# ceiling — for every governed scope, its effective state and where it comes
# from — without exposing any write path. It mirrors the model's own
# scope-name-agnostic style: a single per-archetype serializer, driven by
# ``SCOPE_CATALOG``, so the view auto-covers any scope a future release (or the
# companion) registers with zero handler edits.

      what stops the viewer mis-reporting a host-only pin as an install-wide

    A composed ``policy+profile`` row needs the policy control itself, not just the

    AND across levels, so when the POLICY half is already off the result is off on

    composition algebra (``_compose_controls`` — the same helper the evaluator's
    ``compose_profiles`` path uses); it does not re-implement ``policy ∩
    profile``. A scope governed by neither level is reported ``ungoverned`` (it
    permits — the standalone default), so with NO policy and NO profile every
    scope is ``ungoverned`` and the response is byte-identical to a standalone
    host.

    **The reported ceiling is the HOST surface's, and only the host's.** The host
    profile governs in-process actions that no user-facing surface drives (app
    activation, workspace admission), so it legitimately pins capabilities like
    ``cron`` and ``messaging`` OFF — the host process itself never schedules a job
    or sends a message. Those same capabilities are typically ENABLED for the
    surfaces that do use them, under their own narrower profiles. A row therefore
    describes one surface's posture, never the whole install's: ``scope_note``
    carries that caveat per row (see :func:`_surface_scope_note`), so a viewer
    cannot render "Disabled by policy" as though the feature were off everywhere.

    Synchronous — reading the ceiling is in-memory, but ``resolve_active_scope``
    may read profile files, so async callers MUST offload it (see

    unexpected governance error yields a well-formed ``unavailable`` response
