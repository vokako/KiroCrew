Strict-internal (loopback + ``X-Internal-Secret``): no browser calls these, and
they are the entry point to acting on another live conversation, so a cookie
fall-through would be a genuinely new path rather than a convenience.

The handlers do parsing and status mapping only — resolution, authorization and
the operations themselves live in ``dashboard/session_control.py`` so the verbs
that take a target share one guard.
