    ONE read, TWO rules. ``_merge_unowned_servers`` (a name ABSENT from the
    submission) and :func:`_drop_unbacked_app_entries` (a name PRESENT in a stale
    submission) are two directions of one question -- what does on-disk state say
    about this name -- so neither may read the file for itself. Two reads inside
    one commit unit could only ever agree by luck, and a rule pair disagreeing
    about its baseline is a defect that surfaces as a name both preserved and
    dropped.

    ``None`` AND ``{}`` ARE DIFFERENT ANSWERS and collapsing them is a defect --
    in EITHER direction. ``{}`` means the spec was read and holds no bridge under
    any name; ``None`` means it could not be interpreted at all. That distinction
    only matters to the present-axis rule, and there it decides the verdict:
    against ``{}`` every namespaced name the client submits is an addition the
    platform never made, while against ``None`` nothing is known and nothing may be
    decided. The absent-axis rule is indifferent -- it has nothing to preserve
    either way -- which is why its own read conflated the two harmlessly for as long
    as it was the only caller.

    A MISSING ``mcpServers`` KEY IS ``{}``, NOT ``None``, and the difference is
    load-bearing rather than cosmetic. A readable spec that simply carries no such
    key holds no bridge, which is a definite answer; reading it as "unknown" hands
    the stale-snapshot rule a reason to stand down and lets the resurrection
    through. That state is reachable from this very handler: a PUT whose submission
    omits ``mcpServers`` is persisted verbatim by ``_write_installed_config``, and
    ``_deregister_mcp_servers`` pops its entries out of ``get("mcpServers", {})``
    without ever adding the key back, so a spec can sit keyless while an old editor
    tab still holds a bridge in its snapshot.

    A ``mcpServers`` PRESENT BUT NOT AN OBJECT still answers ``None``, deliberately.
    The file parsed, but that value cannot be interpreted, and the same
    cannot-interpret state is what the submitted-side guard in
    ``_merge_unowned_servers`` refuses to act on. Deleting the client's entries on
    the strength of a value we cannot read is the guess this whole span exists to
    avoid.

    BEST-EFFORT ON AN UNREADABLE SPEC, deliberately. Missing (a first-ever write),
    corrupt, or holding a non-object ``mcpServers`` all answer ``None``: there is
    nothing authoritative to read, and this editor is the user's repair path for
    exactly that state, so failing the PUT closed would leave a broken agent
    unfixable from the dashboard. Neither rule then acts and the snapshot lands as
    it did pre-fix; enabled apps re-register their servers on the next gateway
    start (``reconcile_enabled_app_resources``), so the loss self-heals.

    The CALLER holds bridges' flock across this read and the spec write, so no
    in-gateway writer of this file can commit between them.

    THE STALE-SNAPSHOT AXIS, the mirror of ``_merge_unowned_servers``. That rule
    decides what happens to a name the submission OMITS. This one decides one
    narrow question about a name the submission CONTAINS: may the client CREATE a
    name in the app-namespace region THROUGH THIS PUT? Not while the installed spec
    is READABLE -- so a submitted namespaced name with no row on disk is dropped.
    The readability qualifier is not a hedge: an unreadable spec answers nothing, so
    the submission lands as it did pre-fix, and a rule stated without it would
    contradict the best-effort path below.

    THE REGION IS RESERVED FROM THIS ENDPOINT, not owned by a single writer, and
    the distinction is worth stating because the weaker claim is false. Two paths
    legitimately write a ``:``-containing key into this spec: ``_register_mcp_servers``
    builds every app bridge as ``f"{app_name}:{server_name}"``, and the MCP page's
    ``handlers/mcp.py::_sync_mcp_to_agent_unlocked`` copies a global mcp.json server
    in under ``mcp_server_alias``, which returns a slash-free name UNCHANGED and so
    preserves a colon (``npm:foo`` stays ``npm:foo``). What this rule withholds is
    the ability to introduce such a name through the RAW EDITOR, where the client's
    copy is indistinguishable from a resurrection; a name either of those writers
    has actually placed on disk is present, and therefore untouched.

    THE ROW-BY-ROW TABLE LIVES IN THE SPEC, ``docs/system-specs/modules/app-kit-platform.md``
    section 1a, which is this axis's designated home; the absent axis keeps its
    table in :func:`_app_declared_server_names` instead. Only what a reader of this
    code has to know to not undo it is repeated here.

    ABSENCE FROM DISK IS A VERDICT, not a gap, and it is reached three ways --
    which is why the client's copy cannot be trusted over it:

    * the app was UNINSTALLED (``_deregister_mcp_servers`` removed the bridge and
      the app directory is gone);
    * the app is installed but DISABLED (same deregistration; startup
      reconciliation deliberately never revisits it);
    * the app is installed and ENABLED but the entry was SKIPPED on purpose --
      ``_register_mcp_servers`` refuses to write an HTTP server with no resolvable
      live port, and scrubs any stale entry for it, because a manifest's
      illustrative port is a reachable-LOOKING dead URL that kiro-cli dials on
      every request and that breaks EVERY kiro session, not just that app's.

    WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: it never rewrites a submitted value. Where
    the name is on disk AND in the submission, the submitted row still wins
    untouched -- the editor-snapshot-wins contract kept in #5899 and re-affirmed
    for #6664, pinned by ``test_app_owned_entry_present_in_the_snapshot_is_updated``.
    Reversing it needs a maintainer ruling and is tracked separately.

    THE DECLARED-NAME CENSUS IS DELIBERATELY NOT CONSULTED, and this is the one
    part a later change is most likely to undo, so the reason is here rather than
    only in the spec. The absent-axis rule must name an owner because it decides
    whether to KEEP something the client asked to remove; every candidate here is
    one the client is asking to ADD to a region it does not author, which the
    on-disk map answers by itself. A census consulted here would RESCUE the third
    case above and write back the dead URL the registration path scrubbed on
    purpose. It also keeps this rule free of manifest I/O, so it cannot raise
    :class:`AppOwnershipUnreadable` and adds no new way for a PUT to fail.

    Host-owned names are excluded, including an edition extra whose key contains
    ``:``: that key is the HOST's, and the host axis is unchanged here. Order
    against the absent-axis rule is immaterial -- a name this rule drops is by
    definition not on disk, so it cannot enter that rule's absent set.

    """Re-add ``mcpServers`` entries the submitting client does not own.

    MERGE-ON-WRITE (#6664). This PUT persists a whole-file snapshot the client
    read earlier, and ``apps/bridges.py::_register_mcp_servers`` writes app MCP
    bridges into that same file under its own flock. A registration landing
    between the client's read and its PUT was therefore silently clobbered, and
    the app's tools simply stopped resolving with nothing logged anywhere.

    The rule, in one sentence: **preservation requires positive evidence of app
    or host ownership.** An on-disk entry absent from the submission is kept only
    when :func:`_app_or_host_owned` can name its owner by EXACT name; everything
    else is the client's and is deleted, which is what keeps an ordinary entry the
    user typed into this editor deletable -- including one parked under an
    installed app's namespace. If that evidence cannot be read the PUT is refused
    rather than guessed; see :func:`_app_or_host_owned`.

    The inverse test -- "keep anything no mcp.json scope declares" -- reads as
    equivalent and is not. A server added through this same editor lives ONLY in
    the installed spec, which is not a scope, so it looked unowned and was
    re-inserted on every attempt to remove it: not merely preserved against the
    user's wishes, but permanently undeletable, because each retry re-read the
    same entry. Requiring evidence costs an app bridge nothing, since a bridge is
    always positively identifiable.

    The census is NOT consulted, and the reason is worth naming because an
    earlier cut did consult it: it subtracted every scope-declared name from the
    candidates ahead of the ownership test, as precedence carried over from the
    prefix-matching era. With ownership matched by exact manifest name that
    subtraction could only ever remove a name that IS provably owned, so a user
    who also declared ``demo:notes`` in their own mcp.json made every stale PUT
    delete app ``demo``'s live bridge. Proven ownership therefore outranks a
    declaration, and a name with no proven owner is deleted whether a scope
    declares it or not -- which leaves the census unable to change any verdict.

    Two consequences worth naming rather than discovering:

    * A host-MANAGED server the rebuild RE-ADDS (``agent.emission_eligible_mcp_servers``)
      is preserved. That is not a new restriction -- the rebuild re-adds those
      entries unconditionally, so removing one through this editor never stuck.
      The qualifier is load-bearing: a managed entry the rebuild would NOT emit
      (an ``opt_in`` grant, or one whose ``spec_gate`` is shut) is deleted like
      any other absent entry, because nothing re-adds it and preserving it made
      the grant unrevocable and the gated backend resurrectable.
    * An app bridge cannot be removed through this endpoint. That is the issue's
      explicit intent; the app lifecycle (disable/uninstall, which calls
      ``_deregister_mcp_servers``) is what removes it.

    BEST-EFFORT ON AN UNREADABLE SPEC, deliberately -- and the read itself now
    lives in :func:`_on_disk_mcp_servers`, performed once on this rule's behalf and
    on :func:`_drop_unbacked_app_entries`'s, so both directions decide from the
    SAME bytes instead of from two reads that could disagree. A corrupt installed
    spec has no parseable entries to preserve, and this editor is the user's repair
    path for exactly that state -- failing the PUT closed would leave a broken
    agent with no way to fix it from the dashboard. So an unreadable spec preserves
    nothing and the snapshot lands as it did pre-fix; enabled apps re-register
    their servers on the next gateway start
    (``reconcile_enabled_app_resources``), so the loss self-heals.

    WHAT REMAINS, now that the caller holds bridges' flock across this read and
    the spec write (see :func:`_commit_agent_config`). Every writer of this file
    INSIDE the gateway takes that same flock -- ``_register_mcp_servers``,
    ``_deregister_mcp_servers``, ``reregister_app_mcp_servers``, the agent
    rebuild, and ``handlers/mcp.py``'s spec syncs -- so no app registration or
    deregistration can interleave with this read any more, in either direction.
    The earlier writeup here claimed a bounded, self-healing residual for that
    window; that was wrong twice over, and both halves are now moot: the
    deregistration direction was never self-healing (startup reconciliation only
    re-registers ENABLED apps, so a resurrected bridge from a disabled or
    uninstalled app persisted indefinitely), and the window itself is closed
    rather than narrowed.

    The residual that is real is a writer OUTSIDE this process that does not take
    the flock -- kiro-cli writing the spec itself, or a user editing the file by
    hand. Nothing in the gateway can serialize against those, and the same
    exposure applies to every other writer here, so it is a property of the file
    rather than of this change. Torn reads are not part of it: the in-process
    writers all go through ``atomic_write``, so a reader sees the whole old file
    or the whole new one.

    weaker version of this: with ``demo`` installed, a client entry named
    ``demo:custom`` matches the prefix and becomes permanently undeletable.

    Read through :func:`bridges._registration_source`, which resolves a shipped
    builtin from its immutable package root rather than its mutable installed
    snapshot, so installed metadata cannot borrow a builtin's name and claim
    entries under it.

    THE COMPLETE CLASSIFICATION TABLE for an entry ABSENT from the client's
    submitted snapshot. Every reachable combination of name shape, install state,
    enablement, declaration and manifest readability appears here, so the
    classification of any absent entry is a table lookup rather than a judgement:

    THE HOST ROWS ARE NOT ONE ROW, and collapsing them was a shipped defect. A
    host-managed entry is preserved *because the rebuild re-adds it*, so the
    justification only reaches the entries the rebuild actually emits. It does not
    reach an ``opt_in`` server (``kirocrew-dashboard``: never auto-emitted, and a
    refresh keeps an existing grant current without ever re-granting a removed
    one), which preservation made undeletable through the only surface that can
    revoke the grant; nor a server whose ``spec_gate`` is CLOSED
    (``kirocrew-computer`` on an unsupported platform, or with computer use off),
    which both spec writers ``pop`` — preserving it resurrects exactly the backend
    the gate exists to keep unspawned, and the next rebuild removes it again. The
    eligibility test is therefore the emitter's own
    (``agent.emission_eligible_mcp_servers``), not a second copy here.

    ABSENCE IS PROVEN BY ``lstat`` RAISING ``FileNotFoundError``, nothing weaker.
    ``Path.is_file()`` and ``Path.is_dir()`` answer False for a malformed path as
    readily as for a missing one, so screening on them alone read a broken
    symlink, a directory-where-a-file-belongs, or an unstattable path as "not
    installed" and made that app's live bridges deletable. Every present-but-wrong
    shape raises instead -- see :func:`_require_present_shape`, which screens the
    shape at the CALL SITE so ``manager.app_enabled_state`` keeps the contract its
    other callers rely on. The ENUMERATION obeys the same rule: each child of the
    apps root is stat'ed explicitly rather than filtered through ``is_dir()``,
    because pathlib routes that fault through ``_ignore_error`` and hands back a
    plain False for ENOENT, ENOTDIR, EBADF and ELOOP alike -- so a child that is a
    symlink loop looked like a regular file and was skipped, deleting the bridges
    of the app under that name. Only a resolved stat may exclude a child, and only
    by proving it is not a directory.

    Four justifications carry the rows that are not self-evident:

    * A SCOPE DECLARATION DOES NOT OUTRANK PROVEN OWNERSHIP. An earlier cut
      subtracted every scope-declared name from the candidates ahead of this test,
      as precedence carried over from the prefix-matching era. Against EXACT
      manifest names that subtraction could only ever remove a name that IS
      provably owned: a user who also declares ``demo:notes`` in their own mcp.json
      made every stale PUT delete app ``demo``'s live bridge. A declared name with
      no proven owner is deleted anyway, by the general rule, so the census cannot
      change a verdict and is not consulted.

    * DISABLED ⇒ DELETE. The disable lifecycle owns bridge removal
      (``_deregister_mcp_servers``), and a deregistration that FAILED during
      disable leaves a stale entry behind. Startup reconciliation only
      re-registers ENABLED apps, so it never revisits that entry: preserving it
      would keep a disabled app's code launchable through the retained bridge
      forever. Ownership therefore requires installed AND enabled.
    * ABSENT ``enabled`` FIELD ⇒ ENABLED. This matches ``apps.manager``'s own
      parse exactly -- ``InstalledApp.from_dict`` reads
      ``bool(data.get("enabled", True))`` (manager.py:170) over a dataclass whose
      default is ``enabled: bool = True`` (manager.py:114). A legacy record
      written before the field existed is treated as enabled everywhere else in
      the tree, and disagreeing here would delete the live bridges of an app the
      rest of the system considers running.
    * UNREADABLE ⇒ FAIL LOUD, never a guess. Preserving on an unreadable source
      strands undeletable entries; deleting clobbers live bridges over a fault
      that may be transient. The refusal is raised before any durable write.

    Enablement comes from :func:`manager.app_enabled_state`, whose tri-state is
    written for exactly this caller: its own docstring separates "not installed"
    and "unreadable" *because* collapsing them is "the wrong [answer] for a
    caller deciding whether to DELETE its files". ``True``/``False`` are definite
    answers and ``None`` means the metadata could not be read. ``is_app_enabled``
    and ``list_apps`` are both unusable here -- each collapses an unreadable
    record into a plain "no", which silently narrows ownership and deletes that
    app's bridges.

    POSITIVE identification by EXACT NAME, and both halves of that matter. The
    inverse test -- "preserve anything no mcp.json scope declares" -- made a
    server the user typed into the raw editor permanently undeletable, because it
    lives only in the installed spec and the spec is not a scope. A prefix test
    over installed app ids reproduced the same defect for any name the client
    parked under an app's namespace. Only an exact name an owner actually claims
    is evidence.

    Two sources, both narrow:

    * HOST-managed, and only the entries a rebuild would actually RE-ADD:
      ``agent.emission_eligible_mcp_servers()`` — the always-emitted managed
      servers (cron/core) plus the edition's ``_extra_mcp_servers``. Preserving
      one is justified BY that re-add, so the set has to be the emitter's, which
      is why it is imported rather than recomputed here. The two managed entries
      a rebuild does NOT re-add are excluded and stay deletable: an ``opt_in``
      grant (``kirocrew-dashboard``) that no rebuild re-introduces, and a
      server whose ``spec_gate`` is shut (``kirocrew-computer``), which both spec
      writers actively ``pop``. Preserving those made a revocation impossible
      through the only surface that can revoke it, and resurrected a backend the
      gate exists to keep unspawned.
    * APP-declared: the exact ``<app>:<server>`` set from installed manifests --
      see :func:`_app_declared_server_names`.

    ON A FAILED READ THIS RAISES rather than guessing, because both guesses are
    wrong and each one is a defect this span has already shipped. Preserving
    every namespaced entry makes entries permanently undeletable; treating the
    declared set as empty deletes live app bridges over a fault that may be
    transient -- the very clobber #6664 exists to fix. The PUT turns the raise
    into a 500 the client can retry, and because this runs at step (0a) before
    any durable write, all three targets stay byte-identical.

    That branch IS reachable: manifests are separate files under the apps
    directory, not covered by the installed-spec flock this unit holds, so a
    corrupt ``app.json`` or an unreadable apps directory reaches it and persists
    until repaired. It is reached whenever ANY candidate is namespaced, host-owned
    or not: the refusal is per-PUT rather than per-entry, so an edition extra
    whose name contains ``:`` is refused alongside a genuinely app-shaped one. That
    is the fail-loud direction and it is retryable, so it stays as it is.

    This function is the commit half of the invariant stated at the
    :func:`api_agent_config` PUT branch: it is the ONLY place that branch
    persists application state, it is purely synchronous, and it is dispatched
    exactly once through the shielded ``_offload_config_write``. Those three
    properties make a PUT **non-cancellable but not rollback-atomic**:

    * Purely synchronous — there is no await between two writes, so no
      cancellation and no other task can be interleaved into the sequence. A
      worker thread cannot be cancelled at all, so once this starts it runs to
      completion.
    * Dispatched once, shielded — the caller cannot unwind (and so cannot
      release the transaction lock) until this has returned. The alternative
      shape, awaiting each write separately under the lock, puts a cancellation
      point between writes however wide the lock is.
    * The only writer — nothing durable happens before the call, so every
      failure earlier in the handler leaves the three targets byte-identical.

    What that does NOT buy is rollback: an I/O failure (permission, quota, disk
    full, lock-open, a failed atomic rename) stops the sequence where it is, and
    the writes already committed stay committed. The honest failure prefixes, in
    order, are:

    0. the governance filter raises — nothing durable, and the caller's 500 is
       exact (it fails closed, so a raise withholds rather than grants). The
       merge-on-write step ahead of it (0a) adds one prefix of its own, and it is
       the harmless end: it can raise :class:`AppOwnershipUnreadable` while
       having mutated only the in-memory *config*, so the caller's 500 is exact
       and all three targets are byte-identical (see
       :func:`_app_or_host_owned` for why refusing beats guessing). The
       stale-snapshot rule shares that step and adds NO prefix of its own: it
       performs no I/O beyond the one read they share and cannot raise, so its
       only effect is on the in-memory *config*;
    1. the ``config.json`` read raises :class:`ConfigReadError` — nothing
       durable, and the caller's 500 is exact;
    2. the ``config.json`` write fails — nothing durable;
    3. the first bookkeeping write fails — ``config.json`` updated;
    4. the second bookkeeping write fails (the lift can write twice, once per
       key) — ``config.json`` updated plus one bookkeeping key;
    5. the installed-spec write fails — ``config.json`` and bookkeeping
       updated, the spec unchanged.

    Order inside the unit is chosen to make the *earliest* prefixes the *least*
    harmful, and four steps are load-bearing rather than incidental:

    * The merge (0a) precedes the governance filter, so the entries it re-adds
      are governed like any other — see step (0a). It is in the unit at all for
      the same reason as the read at (1): its on-disk read must be adjacent to
      the write it feeds, or an app registration landing during the flock wait
      is clobbered exactly as it was pre-fix.
    * The governance filter is FIRST among the steps that decide what is
      persisted, and it is in here at all so that the grant decision cannot be
      made against a ceiling that changes before the write publishes it — see
      step (0). Ahead of every write because it persists nothing, so its own
      fail-closed raise costs no partial write.
    * The read is FIRST among the writes' own inputs. It is the only
      fallible-by-decision I/O step, and running it here — immediately adjacent
      to the write it feeds — is what closes the lost-update window: on the
      previous shape the caller read the baseline and the worker wrote it back
      one executor hop later, so a concurrent writer landing in that gap had its
      unrelated fields silently reverted.
    * The bookkeeping lift runs AFTER the ``config.json`` write (so prefix 2
      leaves the sidecar untouched, restoring the pre-lock ordering) but BEFORE
      the spec write, because it STRIPS Kiro Crew keys (``model_managed`` /
      ``cc_model``) out of the same *config* dict the spec write then persists —
      reverse the two and the spec lands with fields kiro-cli's
      ``deny_unknown_fields`` rejects (#2570).

    Everything else fallible has already been decided by the caller: *config* is
    parsed and validated, *removed_per_key* is the computed ``removedTools`` map,
    and both paths are resolved.

    Returns whatever the bookkeeping lift returns (True when it stripped a
    key), so the caller can log it after the lock is released — logging is not
    durable state and has no business inside the unit.

            # outlive the request it describes.

            #
            # Structurally that is two phases with nothing in between:
            #
            #   PHASE 1 (below, off the locks) — GATHER AND DECIDE. Parse, diff,
            #   resolve every path. Persists nothing, so any failure or
            #   cancellation here leaves all three target files byte-identical
            #   and the 4xx/5xx it returns is honest.
            #
            #   PHASE 2 — COMMIT. Take the transaction lock, then the config
            #   lock, then hand the GOVERNANCE FILTER, the ``config.json`` READ
            #   and ALL THREE durable writes to :func:`_commit_agent_config`
            #   through the shielded ``_offload_config_write``, exactly once.
            #   The read is inside the unit rather than in front of it: adjacent
            #   to the write it feeds, it cannot capture a baseline that a
            #   concurrent writer then updates before the worker publishes it
            #   back. The filter is inside for the same reason in the other
            #   direction: in front of the locks its verdict could go stale
            #   during a contended, unbounded flock wait, and the write would
            #   publish a grant governance had already withheld.
            #
            # Why this shape and not "the lock covers more": three prior fixes
            # widened the lock and each time the next defect was a SEQUENCING or
            # CANCELLATION fault inside the widened span — a fallible read placed
            # after a write, an await between two writes, a worker outliving the
            # await that dispatched it. Widening a span cannot fix those, because
            # they are properties of what happens INSIDE it. Collapsing the writes
            # to a single synchronous unit removes the interleaving points instead
            # of trying to cover them: there is no "between two writes" to land in.
            #
            # The three lock layers, transaction lock outermost:
            #
            # 1. ``_get_mcp_lock`` (~/.kiro/settings/mcp.lock) is the MCP
            #    TRANSACTION lock. Agent spec files are a census source for the
            #    MCP config transactions in handlers/mcp.py, which read the
            #    current state and then act on it while holding this lock. An
            #    unlocked write can land inside that read-then-act window, so the
            #    transaction commits a decision about spec contents that changed
            #    underneath it.
            # 2. ``_get_config_lock`` is the in-process lock every other
            #    ``config.json`` read-modify-writer in the dashboard takes
            #    (messaging channel savers, security, the MCP handlers, agent
            #    create/update/delete). This PUT's own RMW now spans an executor
            #    hop, so the event loop no longer serializes it for free: without
            #    this lock a sibling RMW can read the same baseline and the last
            #    atomic rename silently reverts the other side's unrelated
            #    settings. Held ACROSS the offload for exactly the reason
            #    api_mcp_gateway_set_stub holds it across its own offload.
            # 3. ``bridges._mcp_lock(target=installed_path)``
            #    (~/.kiro/agents/kirocrew.lock) is the FILE lock. The transaction
            #    lock does not cover it: apps/bridges.py does whole-file
            #    read-modify-writes of THIS SAME file under that separate flock
            #    (app enable/disable, MCP (de)registration). Holding only the
            #    transaction lock leaves a concurrent app enable and this PUT
            #    each writing the whole file, and the last atomic rename silently
            #    discards the other side's changes.
            #
            # Order is transaction → config → file and must stay that way. Each
            # edge already exists in the tree and none is inverted anywhere:
            # transaction→config at api_mcp_toggle / api_mcp_toggle_all /
            # api_mcp_remove in handlers/mcp.py, config→file wherever
            # ``_sync_mcp_to_agent`` runs under the config lock (api_mcp_remove,
            # api_mcp_server_detail, mcp_discover, api_capability_mcp_install),
            # and no config-lock or file-lock holder in the tree acquires the
            # transaction lock inside, so there is no ABBA cycle. The file lock is
            # taken inside the worker thread (by ``_commit_agent_config``, which
            # holds it across the whole unit so merge-on-write's on-disk READ and
            # the spec write cannot be split by an app writer) — a blocking flock
            # on the event loop would freeze the gateway while app registration
            # holds it. Widening that innermost hold changes no ORDER: the outer
            # two are already held before the unit is dispatched.
            # Nothing else in this branch takes a cross-process lock: governance +
            # SEL and agent_state take none, so running the filter inside the
            # worker adds no lock edge to the transaction → config → file order.
            #

    ``kiro chat --list-models`` is a CATALOG, not an entitlement: it returns the
    same rows whatever the account's tier, so after a downgrade the picker kept
    offering (and kept SHOWING as selected) a model no turn can run. The
    per-session ``session/new`` ``availableModels`` list is the tier-aware one —
    the same signal ``model_is_unusable`` pre-flights against before the wire —
    so when a live session has one, it wins here too. Same rule #1549 applied to
    the claude_code branch in :func:`_cc_models`: advertised is authoritative
    when present.

    The keep/drop decision delegates to ``model_is_unusable`` rather than
    comparing ids here, so the picker cannot disagree with the wire about what
    "this account can run" means. A local comparison would be a second spelling
    of that question — the exact drift that predicate exists to prevent — and any
    difference in how the two fold spelling variants shows up as a row the picker
    offers and the wire then withholds. A literal miss is retried through
    ``resolve_pin_spelling``, the same namespace fold the wire sites apply
    before withholding — but the row is REWRITTEN to the advertised spelling
    the fold answers with (and dropped when another row already offers that
    spelling): the selection sinks (the agent/crew pin validator and
    ``set_model``'s pre-flight) compare the picked value literally, so a row
    must carry an id they accept verbatim, not the catalog's stale
    ``<namespace>::<bare-id>`` qualifier it resolved from.

    The ``auto`` sentinel is never filtered: it means "inherit whatever the
    session already resolved", so it stays selectable even on a backend that does
    not advertise it by name.

    Fails open in every unknowable case — no live session, a backend that
    advertises nothing, or an advertised set that does not intersect the catalog
    at all (a namespace mismatch rather than an entitlement, e.g. the claude
    backend's bare ids). Filtering on any of those would empty the picker, which

def _roster_mask(value: object) -> str:
    """Render ONE agent-record value for a roster row, masking what cannot be shown.

    Every record value is agent- or package-writable: an agent can edit
    ``config.json`` directly, and ``_do_agents_sync`` copies ``description``
    straight off a discovered agent spec, so a third-party package controls that
    string. A value the redactors would alter -- credential- or
    exfiltration-URL-shaped text -- is therefore replaced WHOLESALE by
    ``_SENSITIVE_MASK``, the sentinel ``_masked_config_dict`` already uses for
    the same job on ``GET /api/config/kirocrew``. A non-string (the loader lets
    an object through five declared-``str`` fields) is masked too: it is not
    renderable, so there is nothing to show. Benign content is byte-identical.

    **A fixed sentinel rather than redacting in place, and that is the whole
    design.** An in-place scrub makes the browser's view a FUNCTION of the
    stored value, so the write-side rule that keeps a read-modify-write from
    persisting that view (``_carries_mask``) has to recognise it by
    recomputing the transform -- which breaks in two ways a sentinel does not:

    * **Redaction-chain drift.** #8465 wraps this same response in
      ``redact_record_strings``, whose order differs from ``_redact_external``'s.
      A recomputed-equality rule would stop matching and silently persist the
      redacted text; an exact sentinel survives, because scrubbing
      ``_SENSITIVE_MASK`` leaves it unchanged.
    * **Stale-view skew.** If the stored value changes between the GET and the
      PUT (an agent editing ``config.json``, a second dashboard tab), a
      recomputed rule compares the old view against the NEW value, fails to
      match, and writes ``[REDACTED ...]`` text into the config as though the
      operator had typed it. The sentinel does not depend on the stored value at
      all, so this cannot happen.

    Named cost: a value containing one credential-shaped token is masked
    entirely, so the owner loses the benign remainder of that string rather than
    seeing it partially redacted. That is the same trade ``_masked_config_dict``
    already makes, and it is the price of a view that cannot be mistaken for
    content.

def _carries_mask(incoming: object) -> bool:
    """True when *incoming* still CARRIES the mask, so it is not real content.

    The write-side half of ``_roster_mask``. A client that read a roster row and
    echoed it back sends the mask; persisting it would destroy the operator's
    stored value. Such a field is treated as UNCHANGED instead.

    **Containment, not equality.** An exact-match rule closes only the
    echo-it-back case. The editor renders the mask into a text input, so an
    operator who APPENDS to it submits ``"<mask> and also X"`` -- not equal to the
    sentinel, so an equality rule would persist the redaction glyphs plus the
    addition, replacing the stored original. Any string still containing the
    sentinel is therefore refused as content.

    Consequence, stated because it is a real limitation and not a free win: a
    genuine replacement must OMIT the sentinel entirely -- clear the field, then
    type the new value. An edit that keeps the mask and adds to it is dropped
    rather than half-applied. That is lossy in the operator's INTENT, but it never
    destroys what is stored, and the alternative writes redaction glyphs into
    ``config.json`` over the real value.

    This is the remedy ``_masked_config_dict``'s docstring prescribes -- "MUST
    treat ``_SENSITIVE_MASK`` as 'unchanged' and keep the stored value" -- read
    the strict way. Because the comparison is against a FIXED sentinel and never
    against a recomputation of the stored value, it is immune to which redaction
    chain produced the view and to the stored value having changed since the read.

    Accepted residual, identical in kind to the config endpoint's: an operator
    cannot store a value containing the mask string. It is eight U+2022 bullets.

    **Recursive, because one shipped field is STRUCTURED.** ``avatar`` is a dict
    whose ``traits`` values are masked (``_roster_avatar``), so an echoed avatar
    carries the sentinel one level DOWN. A top-level-only check sees a ``dict``,
    answers "not a mask", and lets ``_safe_avatar`` persist the sentinel over the
    stored trait -- the exact corruption this predicate exists to prevent, one
    level deeper than the flat fields. Any string anywhere inside the value
    therefore counts.

    Cost of the recursive form, stated because it is sharper than the flat one: if
    an avatar carries ANY masked trait, the whole avatar field is treated as
    unchanged, so an edit to a DIFFERENT trait in the same avatar is dropped too.
    A partial merge would be the alternative, and it is worse: it would have to
    decide field-by-field which half of a structured value is authoritative, and
    getting that wrong writes glyphs into stored config. Refusing the whole field
    never destroys what is stored.

    ``avatar`` is a ``dict``, so ``_roster_mask``'s non-string rule would blank it
    wholesale -- and the dashboard needs it: ``AgentSelector.tsx`` declares
    ``avatar?: unknown`` commented "verbatim from the backend", and ``main``'s
    roster still ships it via the ``asdict`` spread this PR replaces. Withholding
    it would REGRESS a live feature rather than narrow a disclosure, so it is
    named in the allowlist like every other shipped field.

    **A shape allowlist, with masking confined to the leaves that can carry user
    text.** ``_safe_avatar`` is the config's own validator, so only
    ``{"kind": "ghost", "traits": {...}}`` and ``{"kind": "image", "v": ...,
    "file": "<digest>.<ext>"}`` survive and junk collapses to ``{}``. Within that,
    ONLY ``traits`` values are masked:

    - ``kind`` and ``v`` are structural. Mask ``kind`` and the dashboard can no
      longer tell a ghost from an uploaded picture.
    - ``file`` is PINNED by ``_AVATAR_FILE_PIN_RE`` to ``<16-hex>.<ext>``, so it is
      not arbitrary text. A value constrained by a regex is safer than a masked
      one: the pin REFUSES a bad value where masking would destroy a good one, and
      a masked ``file`` makes the per-crew avatar endpoint resolve nothing --
      silently breaking the image.
    - ``traits`` values, and the ``eyes``/``mouth`` values of each
      ``expressions`` state, are the only user-authored strings here, so they go
      through ``_roster_mask`` like any other roster string. The renderer resolves
      an unrecognized trait to absent (``EYES[k] ?? ''``), so a masked trait
      degrades that axis rather than breaking the face.
    - ``sounds`` values are constrained by ``_safe_sounds`` to a shipped preset
      name, so they are pinned rather than masked -- the same reason ``file`` is.

    Honest limit on how far the two rules can be told apart: because
    ``_safe_avatar`` already pins every non-``traits`` leaf to a shape the redactors
    do not alter (a literal ``kind``, a digest ``file``, a hex ``tile``), a blanket
    mask over the validated dict would behave the SAME as this targeted one today.
    The targeted rule is chosen for intent and for the day that pin loosens, not
    because a live defect separates them -- and no test can pin the difference
    while the shape validator holds.

    No host path is disclosed by any of this. The picture's bytes live under the
    data home's agent-fenced ``run/avatars/`` dir and are served by the per-crew
    avatar endpoint; the config field only marks the choice.

    **Key half.** Explicit allowlist -- never a ``dataclasses.asdict`` spread,
    mirroring the rule ``handlers/members.py`` already documents for
    ``GET /api/members``. The response is a network-boundary contract, and a
    spread makes that contract "every field ``KiroCrewAgentConfig`` has now, plus
    every field anyone adds later", automatically -- so a field added by someone
    who never looked at this endpoint (internal bookkeeping, a filesystem path, a
    capability hint, a credential-shaped one) ships to the browser by omission.
    Naming each field inverts the default: nothing leaves unless it is added here
    deliberately (#8454). Both row sources go through this one function, so the
    ``cfg.agents`` rows and the project-scope rows cannot drift into different
    key sets.

    **Value half.** Every record value goes through ``_roster_mask``, for every
    caller, uniformly -- see there for why they are all untrusted and why the
    mask is a fixed sentinel. ``_carries_mask`` is its write-side half in
    ``api_kirocrew_agent_update``; neither is correct alone, and an end-to-end
    test does the GET then the PUT to prove the pair.

    Uniform rather than per-field on purpose: an earlier revision exempted the
    fields the agents page happens to write back today, which encoded a claim
    about the CLIENT that this side could not enforce -- and it was already
    wrong, because ``api_kirocrew_agent_update`` accepts ``description`` and
    ``source`` too.

    ``name`` is the single exception, and only for the owner: it is the row's
    IDENTITY, addressing ``/api/agents/{name}`` for edit and delete and keying
    the usage sort, and it travels in the URL rather than the body so the
    write-side rule cannot protect it. Masking it would make the row
    unaddressable. An ``app`` token cannot reach those owner-gated routes, so the
    exemption buys it nothing and ``name`` is masked there. A credential-shaped
    name is now refused at CREATION (``_name_would_be_masked``), closing the hazard
    at its source rather than at this one read site -- but only for names arriving
    through that route, so an already-stored one still reaches here and is still
    masked for every caller but the owner. Named cost: an app that feeds a roster name to another route sees the
    mask, which happens only for a name containing credential- or URL-shaped
    text.

    ``scope`` is never masked: it is a literal written here, not record content.
    The annotation is ``dict[str, object]`` rather than ``dict[str, str]`` because
    of ONE field: ``avatar`` is a structured ``dict`` the dashboard needs verbatim
    (see ``_roster_avatar``). Every other value is a ``str`` -- ``_roster_mask``
    returns one for every input, including the non-strings the loader lets
    through.

    Excluded on purpose, each verified to have NO consumer in ``website/src``:
    ``watchdog_tool_stall_suspect_secs`` and ``watchdog_tool_stall_hard_cap_secs``
    (per-agent watchdog windows -- backend scheduling knobs the roster does not
    render) and ``telegram_account`` (deprecated and inert, and the one record
    field naming an external messaging binding). Adding any of them back is a
    one-line change plus the pinned key set.
