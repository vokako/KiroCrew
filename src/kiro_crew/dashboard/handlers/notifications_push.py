"""App notification producer endpoint (RFC local notification bus, Phase 2).

``POST /api/notifications/push`` lets an authenticated app backend push a
schema-v2 notification through the bus. Security posture (RFC "Security
considerations"):

- The producer identity comes from the verified app token (``request["app"]``,
  set by the token-auth middleware after HMAC validation) — never from the
  request body, so an app cannot impersonate another source.
- The channel must be declared in the app's manifest (``notifications.channels``)
  and the app must currently be enabled; deny-by-default otherwise.
- Pushes are rate limited per app (token bucket); violations are SEL-logged
  and rejected with 429.
