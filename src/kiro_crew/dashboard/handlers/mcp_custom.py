"""Manual MCP server management — add custom servers and edit specs.

Provides ``POST /api/mcp/custom`` (add one or more user-authored servers,
from the Add Custom form or a pasted ``mcpServers`` JSON block) and
``PUT /api/mcp/custom/{name}`` (replace an installed server's spec).

This is the manual-install path for servers not in any registry.  It
REUSES the mcp.json write helpers from ``handlers/mcp.py`` (the file
lock + ``_set_kirocrew_entry`` / ``_replace_kirocrew_spec``) so there is
exactly one code path that mutates MCP config on disk.

Consent stance (mirrors discover-install): servers land
DISABLED unless the request carries ``enable: true`` — which the UI only
sends when the user ticks "Enable immediately", making the tick itself
the consent act.  Editing a spec never changes the enabled state.
