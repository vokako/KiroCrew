"""Direct RTS ``GetUsageLimits`` client for real Kiro credit usage.

Background — why this module exists
-----------------------------------
kiro-cli's ``/usage`` stdout stopped emitting the overage/total for org-managed
KIRO POWER accounts (it now caps at ``10000 of 10000 covered in plan``). The
dashboard credit pill scraped that text, so it froze at the plan limit even
when the account was well into overage. The real numbers still exist — the Kiro
IDE credit meter reads them from the ``GetUsageLimits`` API on the CodeWhisperer
runtime service (RTS). This module calls that same API so KiroCrew surfaces the
true used/limit/overage regardless of how kiro-cli reshuffles its stdout.

Whose credits are these?
------------------------
Several credentials can be readable at once (an IDE cache, a kiro-cli store, a
leftover file from a profile the user has since signed out of), and "unexpired"
does not mean "the one kiro-cli is actually using": a token for a signed-out
profile stays valid at the API until it expires on its own. Picking by fixed path
order therefore reports that profile's credits after a profile switch, and a
gateway restart does not help because the order is the same on boot.

So the caller passes ``expected_arn`` — the profile ARN ``kiro-cli whoami``
reports for itself — and a candidate is only used when its own
ListAvailableProfiles ARN equals it. Credentials for any other account are
skipped without being spent on a GetUsageLimits call. When every candidate is
rejected the function fails closed (``None``) and the caller degrades to
scraping kiro-cli's own ``/usage`` output, which describes the right account by
construction. Showing a different account's number is the failure being
prevented; showing no number for one refresh is not.

There are TWO proofs of ownership, never an unverified path. When whoami reports a
profile ARN, a candidate qualifies by matching it. When it reports none — a Builder
ID account, or an older kiro-cli that prints no ``Profile:`` block, or a whoami that
failed outright — a candidate qualifies only by PROVENANCE: it must come from
kiro-cli's own auth store, where a token is the signed-in account's credential by
construction. That is the same trust argument that makes scraping kiro-cli's own
``/usage`` output safe, so it costs nothing to rely on here.

What is refused in the no-ARN case is a credential from the JSON SSO caches or
another product's store. Those may well be the same account, but nothing proves it,
and treating them as interchangeable is what served one Builder ID account's
leftover token as a different Builder ID account's balance.

Provenance-anchoring is what keeps the free API path available to every account
class. Requiring an ARN instead would push all profile-less accounts onto the text
scrape — which spends credits on every refresh, indefinitely, and hits the smallest
quotas hardest.

It is a read-only client: it reads the live bearer token that kiro-cli already
maintains and makes one authenticated call. The JSON SSO cache files live under
``~/.aws`` (a sensitive path), so they are read via
``hooks.safe_read_file_internal`` (which enforces ``is_sensitive_path`` and
emits a fail-closed SEL audit), not directly. On Linux, where those files are
not refreshed, the live token is read from the kiro-cli/amazon-q SQLite auth
store (``~/.local/share`` — not a sensitive path, so it cannot route through
``safe_read_file_internal``, but the credential read is still SEL-audited via
``hooks.emit_internal_read_audit`` and fails closed if the audit cannot be
recorded — opened read-only). It does NOT self-refresh the token via SSO-OIDC
(kiro-cli keeps the SQLite token fresh during normal use) — on 401/403 it fails
closed and the caller falls back to the legacy text scrape.

The HTTP call uses the Python standard library (``urllib``) rather than a
third-party client, so this module adds no new dependency to the public repo.

Security controls (fixed as acceptance criteria):
  1. Endpoint is a hardcoded AWS prod host from a region table keyed by the
     whoami profile ARN — never config-derived.
  2. TLS verification is always on (default ``ssl`` context: cert chain +
     hostname).
  3. Redirects are disabled (see ``_NoRedirect``) so the token can never be
     replayed to a redirected host.
  4. The bearer token is never logged (only HTTP status codes are).
  5. Any failure returns ``None`` (fail-closed) so the caller degrades to the
     text scrape rather than showing a fabricated number.
  6. The caller runs the returned dict through ``_redact_strings`` before it is
     cached and served.

# the running ``kiro-cli acp`` processes were observed holding descriptors on

# ``~/.local/share`` is not a sensitive credential path, so this read is a direct

# The entries are deliberately UNGUARDED by ``sys.platform``: every candidate is
# existence-checked before it is opened, so a path that cannot exist on the

#
# The Windows entries are the fixed default locations, NOT resolved from

# or falls outside the fence and must not be trusted. A redirected profile
# therefore keeps the text-scrape fallback rather than gaining a forgeable
# trusted path; the same posture as the Linux entry, which does not follow
# ``XDG_DATA_HOME`` redirection either.

# data dir resolves to the local, non-roaming app-data directory -- the same

    A candidate credential is used only when its ownership by the signed-in
    account is PROVEN. There are two proofs, and ``expected_arn`` selects which:

    * **ARN-anchored** (``expected_arn`` is a non-empty ARN — the one
      ``kiro-cli whoami`` reports for itself): a candidate qualifies when its own
      ListAvailableProfiles ARN is present and equal. This admits a credential
      from any readable source, including an IDE cache, because the ARN match is
      the proof.
    * **Source-anchored** (``expected_arn`` is ``None`` — the account has no
      profile ARN, or whoami could not be resolved): a candidate qualifies only if
      it came from kiro-cli's OWN auth store (``from_cli_store``). A token there is
      the signed-in account's credential by construction — the identical trust
      argument that makes scraping kiro-cli's own ``/usage`` output safe. Whatever
      ARN that credential reports is then used for the request payload, so an
      enterprise account on a kiro-cli that prints no ``Profile:`` block still gets
      its real overage figure instead of the lossier scrape.

    ``None`` is therefore NOT an unverified mode: it swaps ARN proof for
    provenance proof. What it will never do is accept a credential from the JSON
    SSO caches or another product's store, which is what let one Builder ID
    account's leftover token be served as a different Builder ID account's balance.
