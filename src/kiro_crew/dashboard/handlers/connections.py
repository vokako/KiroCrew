    removed from the scopes that configure this provider and the runtime's stored
    grant artifacts are unlinked.

    Deleting the artifacts is the whole point of this endpoint. Removing the config
    entry alone leaves a usable refresh token on disk, so a later reconnect resumes
    that grant silently instead of asking for consent -- while the card has already
    told the user this machine's connection was gone.

    What it deliberately does NOT do is revoke at the provider. Nothing here can;
    only the provider can. So the response never claims the upstream grant is dead,
    and the card keeps sending the user to the provider's revoke page as well.

    ``grantRemoved`` and ``grantSurviving`` are separate answers on purpose: the
    artifacts are a pair, and "the token went" is not the same fact as "the grant is
    gone". The caller is told which one happened instead of inferring it from a
