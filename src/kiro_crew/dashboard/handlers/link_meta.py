"""``GET /api/link-meta`` — favicon + title for a link the model emitted.

Chat renders an http(s) link the assistant produced as a chip or card instead of
a bare URL; this endpoint is where the title, description and favicon come from.

Everything security-relevant about *which* URL may be fetched lives in
:mod:`kiro_crew.link_unfurl`. This module owns the parts that need a loop: the
fetch itself, the redirect walk (re-vetting every hop), the read caps, and the
cache/dedup/concurrency layer that keeps a chatty transcript from turning into a
fetch storm.

Two shapes worth knowing before editing:

* **The feature is opt-in and default OFF** (``cfg.dashboard.link_previews``).
  Enabling it means this machine fetches every link the model emits, so the
  disabled path returns 403 before parsing the URL and performs no network
  activity of any kind.
* **The transport is a seam** (:data:`_TRANSPORT`). The redirect walk, the
  content-type filter and the "``Content-Length`` is a hint, not a bound" read
  cap are all policy that must be testable, so they live above the seam and the
  tests substitute a fake transport rather than a fake server.

    field a preview needs (``<title>``, the ``og:*`` tags, the icon ``<link>``) is
    declared in ``<head>``, and :class:`_HeadParser` stops parsing there, so a
    document that merely *continues* past the cap has already delivered the whole
    preview. Rejecting it would discard a payload that is in hand: at the 256 KiB
    cap that loses every heavyweight page on the web — a major retailer's home page
    measures ~730 KB with its ``<title>`` at byte ~36 000 — while looking, in chat,
    exactly like the feature being switched off.

    A head that does not itself fit is the one case where the prefix is worthless,
    and it cannot be recognised from the bytes: ``</head>`` and ``<body`` both occur
    inside scripts, comments and attribute values, where the parser does not treat
    them as the end of the head. So the cut is *reported* rather than judged here,
    and :func:`_build_payload` asks the parser instead — a cut whose title did not
    survive whole is a failure, which keeps such a page on the 10 min negative TTL
    rather than caching an empty or half-a-word preview for the 6 h positive one.

    ``truncate=False`` (an **icon**) — an oversized image is dropped, never
    truncated: half a PNG is not a smaller PNG, it is a corrupt one. The flag is
    therefore always ``False`` in this mode.

    Memory: ``buffered`` never exceeds *limit* in either mode, because each chunk
    is admitted only up to the remaining room — the excess is dropped rather than
    appended and trimmed. Reading then stops on the chunk that crossed the cap;
    that chunk is already off the socket, so chunk granularity is as tight as a
    stream read gets. Reject mode needs that same chunk to know the body overran at
    all, which is why it raises there instead of earlier.

    ``Content-Length`` is an early exit only in reject mode — it is a claim by the
    upstream, so the room check below is the real bound in both modes, and a
    missing, wrong, or deliberately understated header can never admit more than
    *limit* bytes. The transport sends ``Accept-Encoding: identity`` with
    ``auto_decompress=False``, so for an upstream that honors it this caps decoded
    bytes; one that compresses anyway is capped on the compressed stream instead.
