"""Pull-request source data and owner-only review-thread mutation.

The browser sends a GitHub pull-request or GitLab merge-request URL. This
module validates the parsed host and path, then delegates authentication to a
validated absolute provider CLI. Credentials stay inside ``gh``/``glab`` and are
never returned to the browser. Credential-backed access is restricted to the
configured dashboard owner. Standalone local dashboards use their signed
bootstrap identity as the implicit owner when no channel owner is configured.

# from its own composition root instead of shadowing this module on every
# upstream sync.
#
# A plugin supplies only the two things it alone knows: how to recognize its URLs
# and how to fetch them. Everything that makes a provider read SAFE is shared and
# applies to a plugin identically, because the plugin is called from inside it:
#
#   * the full-payload and checks caches, their TTL, entry cap and byte cap;
#   * the direct-fetch admission reservations (so a plugin cannot outgrow the
#     gateway's concurrent-fetch memory ceiling);
#   * `_redact_provider_data` over every returned payload;
#   * `_MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES` enforcement;
#   * owner-only gating and the SEL audit events on every API entry point;
#   * the coalescing of concurrent requests for one URL.
#
# A plugin therefore cannot opt out of redaction or the byte caps by construction
# -- it never sees the request, only a validated `SourceRef`.

# Chip labels are rendered in the sidebar and travel in the slots payload, so a

    WHOLESALE, so an omitted field does not read as "no news" downstream — it
    erases whatever the previous entry had settled.

    That matters because an unsettled read is the COMMON case, not a rare one:
    both providers compute mergeability lazily, so a poll that arrives after the
    provider's evaluation lapsed returns ``unknown`` for a source whose conflict

    payload and emitting a delta — whose refetch re-projects the real answer
    straight back into the cache. That is the repeating chip<->full transition
    ``_CHECK_FLAP_DAMP_THRESHOLD`` exists to contain, so the banner would survive
    only until the damper tripped and then go stale.

    Mirrors the same keep-known rule already applied to the ``ci`` glyph. A real
    answer always wins, including one that CHANGES the value, so this only ever
    fills a gap and cannot pin a stale verdict. Carry-forward stops once the

    `_redact_provider_data` inherits `_URL_RE`, whose path/query class stops at
    whitespace, ``)``, ``"``, ``'`` or ``>``. A URL carrying any of them is
    scanned only as far as that character, so its query -- the part that would
    carry exfiltrated data -- is never inspected, and `_exfil_url_warning`
    returns clean on a truncated match with no ``?`` left in it. Scanning a form
    with those characters percent-encoded is what lets the checks see all of it.

    Every place this converter emits provider text goes through here, because
    the gap is per-CALL-SITE, not per-node-type: when only the link destination
    was covered, an expand title, a mention label, an inline card and a media URL
    each still leaked a high-entropy query, measured one by one.

    The rule is to scan the form that will actually be EMITTED, which is why
    whitespace is handled differently per site rather than uniformly:

    * ``single_url`` -- a link DESTINATION is one address, and the angle-bracket
      form emits it with whitespace percent-encoded, so a space does NOT end it.
      The scan encodes whitespace too, or it would stop where the emitted URL
      does not.
    * otherwise -- in prose a space really does end the URL. Verified against the
      renderer: for `https://host/a?data= <blob>` the emitted anchor's href is
      `https://host/a?data=`, so following text cannot ride along in a fetchable
      address. Encoding whitespace here treated a URL and the next word as one
      address: a URL followed by a commit SHA scanned as a query carrying the SHA,
      the entropy heuristic fired, and the WHOLE paragraph was replaced.

    When nothing is found the ORIGINAL text comes back, so no encoding is ever
    visible in the ordinary case. When something IS found the redacted encoded
    form is returned: the marker replaces the URL wholesale, and a stray percent
    escape beside a redaction marker is a better outcome than emitting a URL that

# ── Conditional revalidation of an expired GitHub payload ────────────────────
# An expired full payload used to mean the whole provider fanout again (the core
# `gh pr view`, the files, review-comment and rollup reads, and the merge-state
# re-reads) even when nothing about the pull request had moved. GitHub's REST
# API honours `If-None-Match`, and an authenticated `304 Not Modified` is free on
# the primary rate limit, so an expired github.com payload is first REVALIDATED
# with small conditional GETs; only when one reports a change does the fanout
# run. Together the probes cover what the panel renders:
#   * `issues/{n}` -- its ETag moves with the pull request's `updated_at`, i.e.
#     title/body/labels/lifecycle (a reopen included), a push (synchronize),
#     reviews, and comments. `pulls/{n}` is deliberately NOT the probe: it
#     embeds the base/head repository objects whose live counters (open issues,
#     stars, pushed_at) change its ETag on a busy repository without the pull
#     request changing.
#   * `commits/{head_sha}/check-runs` and `commits/{head_sha}/status` -- CI
#     hangs off the commit, not the pull request, so `updated_at` never moves
#     for it; these two ETags do. Both are needed: check runs and legacy commit
#     statuses are separate resources, and `statusCheckRollup` renders both.
#     Skipped for a merged or closed pull request, whose CI the panel and the
#     chip no longer track.
# The merge pair (`mergeable`/`mergeStateStatus`) is recomputed lazily by GitHub
# and moves no validator; it is carried by the chip refresh, which drops the
# full payload on a changed merge pair (see the chip <-> full protocol).
# GitHub's GraphQL API -- what `gh pr view` speaks -- has no conditional
# requests at all, which is why the probes are REST.
#
# Strictly 304-only: a probe that answers 200 (including the first probe of a
# URL, which has no validator to send and only LEARNS the ETags) or that fails
# is "unknown", and unknown runs the fanout. Nothing is ever judged unchanged by
# comparing bodies. An explicit refresh, a mutation invalidation and any
# non-GitHub provider (GitLab, a registered plugin) skip the probes entirely.

# ── Repository visibility (public vs private) ────────────────────────────────
# Chip status (state / CI rollup) is credential-backed provider data, so it is
# sent only to the owner connection by default. But for a PUBLIC repository that
# same lifecycle state is world-visible on the provider's website, so withholding
# it from a legitimate authenticated dashboard user buys no confidentiality — it
# only removes the chip's most useful signal (is this PR merged / closed / green).
#
# This cache lets the status gate admit a public-repo link for a dashboard-user
# connection while keeping PRIVATE repos strictly owner-only. It is keyed by
# ``provider|host|owner|repo`` (not by PR URL): visibility is a property of the
# repository, and one repo backs many PR chips — so a per-repo entry, refreshed
# on the SAME cadence as the chip status it gates, costs at most one extra
# provider read per repo per TTL, shared across every chip on it.
#
# Fails CLOSED: until a repo is positively known public, ``is_repo_public``
# returns None and the gate treats it as owner-only. A provider read that errors
# or is unauthorized never flips a repo to public.
#
# TTL == the CHECK TTL, deliberately: the status a public flag authorizes is
# refreshed every ``_CHECK_TTL_SECS`` and ``schedule_visibility_refresh`` runs
# on the SAME calls, so visibility is never more than one refresh cycle staler
# than the status it gates. A repo that flips public->private therefore stops
# authorizing non-owner status within ~one check TTL (not an hour): the paired
# status refresh re-reads visibility, the flip is observed, and a stale entry
# fails closed the moment it crosses this TTL. This bounds the private-status
# exposure to a single short refresh window rather than a long one.

    Fire-and-forget with inflight dedup, mirroring ``schedule_check_refresh``.
    One entry per repo (deduped by visibility key), TTL-paced, so a large
    workspace of PRs on a handful of repos costs a handful of reads per repo per
    TTL.

    ``on_update`` is invoked (debounced) whenever a repo's RENDERED public flag
    flips, so the sidebar re-serializes when a chip should appear or disappear.
    ``force`` bypasses the TTL freshness check for callers that know the repo's
    status just moved (the turn-boundary refresh), so visibility is revalidated
    in lockstep with the forced status read rather than lagging it.

    On the ``force`` path the cached PUBLIC flag is invalidated SYNCHRONOUSLY
    before the refresh task is spawned: the forced status read and the
    visibility read run as concurrent tasks, and if status finished first it
    could otherwise broadcast fresh (now-private) status against a still-cached-
    public visibility entry (a non-owner private-status leak). Dropping the entry
    to unknown up front makes ``is_repo_public`` fail closed for the whole
    in-flight window; the refresh restores ``public`` only on a positive
    reconfirmation, and its ``on_update`` re-serializes when it does.
