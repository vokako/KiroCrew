"""Auth refresh endpoints: ``GET /api/auth/me`` and ``POST /api/auth/refresh``.

Spec: ``docs/system-specs/modules/dashboard-token-auth.md``.

Both endpoints handle their own auth (the standard ``token_auth_middleware``

the refresh path). ``/api/auth/me`` requires a valid access cookie and is
gated by the standard middleware.

# availability gap (a pinned-at-capacity map denying legitimate new IPs while

    itself resolves a verified peer, the fresh token is pinned to that peer's

    session, whose ``ip:`` pin the middleware sets at the exchange: letting such
    a session rotate without this drops the pin on the first rotation, so a
