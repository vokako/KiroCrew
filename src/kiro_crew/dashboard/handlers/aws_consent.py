"""Paid-AWS-service consent REST API — the confirmation surface.

``GET    /api/aws/consent?service=<id>``  what would be billed, and whether confirmed
``POST   /api/aws/consent``               record the operator's confirmation
``DELETE /api/aws/consent?service=<id>``  withdraw it

This handler is the operator's own out-of-band control surface, and being the
only writer (with the ``kirocrew aws-consent`` CLI) is what makes "the agent
cannot consent to spending the operator's money" true: the grant lives on the
keystone floor, which the agent can neither read nor write, and this handler
opens that path directly rather than through the agent tool gate.

The GET is deliberately the side that performs the ``sts:GetCallerIdentity``
probe. It is free, non-mutating, and it is the whole point of the surface --
showing the operator the account, region and credential source BEFORE they
agree. It is also where account drift is caught: if a grant was recorded for one
account and the profile now resolves to another, the probe revokes the stale
grant here, so the next synthesis refuses and the operator is asked again.

Blocking work is offloaded. The keystone read/write touches the filesystem and
the identity probe spawns the AWS CLI, so neither may run on the event loop.

    Confirming a charge spends the owner's money, so it is an owner action --

    to be shut out, and only the second is obvious:

    * an APP token: an app declaring the ``/api/aws/consent`` permission would
      otherwise mint a grant with no human in the loop -- the keystone stops the
      agent WRITING the file and the CLI verb was removed, so this was the same
      door's third key.
    * an allowed MESSAGING user: a Slack allow-listed non-owner who runs
      ``!dashboard`` authenticates with ``app == ""``, so an app-only check let
      them through to authorize spending in the OWNER's AWS account.

    ``is_owner_dashboard_request`` already encodes exactly that rule (app must be
    present and empty, caller must equal ``owner_id`` or be a local-owner
    subject), so it is reused rather than re-derived -- the same reason
