"""Tailnet mobile access: the guided path from this laptop to a phone.

The dashboard already had every *piece* of tailnet access — :mod:`kiro_crew.
dashboard.tailnet` resolves the MagicDNS name, :mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.
tailnet_serve` publishes and withdraws ``tailscale serve``, and the CLI wires
them together as ``kirocrew tailnet up`` — and no way to get there from the UI.
An operator who wanted the dashboard on their phone had to know that Tailscale
existed, install it, sign in, find a config switch in a Security panel, restart
the gateway, run a CLI verb, and then mint a token by hand. Each step failed
with a message about the step, never about the sequence.

This module is the sequence. It answers one question — *what is the single next
thing to do?* — and it answers it as a **step**, not as a pile of booleans the
frontend has to re-derive. That is deliberate for the same reason
:func:`kiro_crew.dashboard.handlers.tailnet._derive_state` gives: one owner for
the state machine, so the card and the backend cannot disagree about what a host
with a name but no published serve means.

Three properties are load-bearing.

**This is a LIVE daemon probe, while the existing status endpoint reports the
live request boundary.**  They must stay separate: a daemon name is not trusted
merely because it resolves.  The background recovery path first validates and
adds it to the running Origin/Host set; only then does this endpoint report the
name as trusted.  Until that happens the existing fail-closed restart step is
preserved, including for config changes that still require a restart.

**The QR carries a live credential, so it is minted on demand and never cached.**
The payload is a URL with a session token in its query string. It is not logged,
not stored, and not returned by the status endpoint — only by an explicit POST.
Behind ``tailscale serve`` every request reaches the gateway from ``127.0.0.1``,
so per-device session pinning cannot distinguish the phone from anything else on
the tailnet: the token is the only real credential, which is why
the default TTL here is an hour rather than the 20-hour ceiling the CLI uses.

**Publishing is the consent for staying awake.** A phone loses the dashboard the
moment the laptop idles, so a published tailnet dashboard keeps the SYSTEM awake
(the display may still sleep). Enabling mobile access is the opt-in;
``dashboard.tailscale.keep_awake`` exists to opt back out of the awake half
without unpublishing.

    Ordered by what blocks what, so the operator is never sent to a switch that
    cannot help yet. Each branch is a different remedy:

    1. ``pinned`` — an administrator's ceiling forbids tailnet access. Dead end;
       nothing below is actionable, and offering a toggle would be a lie.
    2. ``install`` / ``start_daemon`` / ``sign_in`` / ``enable_magicdns`` — the
       ways there is no usable tailnet name, kept apart because "install
       Tailscale", "start it", "sign in" and "turn MagicDNS on" are different
       errands. ``start_daemon`` covers both a daemon that does not answer and
       one that answers as stopped (``BackendState "Stopped"``): the errand is
       the same, and the verbatim probe detail tells the two apart.
    3. ``enable_https`` — the name exists but the tailnet has not granted
       certificate provisioning for it. This is a tailnet-wide administrator
       consent and cannot safely be performed by a gateway process.
    4. ``trust_off`` — a name exists, but the gateway is not configured to accept
       it as an origin, so publishing would produce a reachable dashboard that
       answers 403. Config first.
    5. ``restart_gateway`` — configured and resolvable NOW, but the running
       server does not trust this exact name (it may have booted before tailscaled
       or the node name may have changed). The fixed request boundary is rebuilt
       only by the formal gateway restart path.
    6. ``occupied`` — serve holds this port/mount for something that is not this
       dashboard, or its state could not be determined. Publishing would REPLACE
       it, so this refuses and the card renders the manual command
       (``kirocrew tailnet up``) for the operator to run deliberately. Decided
       on ``port_free``, not on ``published`` alone: a stranger's handler at the
       mount reads ``published=False`` exactly as a free port does, and offering
       the publish button for it walked the operator into ``publish()``'s own
       refusal one click later. Serve config that sits entirely on OTHER ports
       is neither — it is invisible to this write and derives ``publish``.
    7. ``publish`` — everything is in place; one action left.
    8. ``ready`` — published and trusted.

    **Dashboard-user only.** ``request["app"]`` is set by the auth middleware on
    every authenticated path — ``""`` for a dashboard user, the app name for an
    app token — so anything else is refused. An app token is admitted by the
    middleware for whatever path prefixes its manifest ``permissions.api``

    ``X-Session-Key``, which an app token does not carry, so it answers "not
    restricted". An ABSENT key is refused too: it means the middleware never ran.

    **Owner only.** Being a dashboard user is NOT enough, because a dashboard user
    is not necessarily *this* dashboard's owner. Telegram, Teams and Slack all
    hand a presigned dashboard link to any ALLOWED user, minting a token whose
    ``sub`` is that user's own id (``telegram/transport_dispatch``,
    ``teams/transport_dispatch``) — so a non-owner can legitimately hold a
    dashboard session. The QR endpoint mints ``generate_token(owner_id or
    "local-app")``, i.e. an OWNER-subject credential, and ``local-app`` is itself
    in ``_LOCAL_DASHBOARD_OWNER_SUBJECTS``. Without this gate any allowed
    messaging user could trade their own scoped session for an owner one — a
    privilege escalation, not merely an over-broad surface. ``core.py``'s
    identical mint is gated by loopback + a local-secret HMAC; this endpoint is
    reachable over the tailnet, so it needs the owner claim instead.
    ``is_owner_dashboard_request`` is reused rather than re-derived: a second copy
    of an authorization predicate is how one path comes to be guarded and its
    sibling not.

    mint either.

    # refresh chain IS issued, so being idle no longer signs the phone out, and
    # both the access cookie and the chain carry the boot id, so a restart does.
    # This is the default because it matches what handing a phone a QR code
    # actually means: signed in while my gateway is up. A clock the operator
    # cannot see, which signs the phone out mid-use and yet keeps working after
    # the gateway is gone, matches nothing anyone asked for.
    #
    # It is a DIFFERENT bound, not a strictly tighter one: a gateway with long
    # uptime grants a correspondingly long session. What keeps that honest is
    # that the bound is something the operator can see and act on — `uptime`
    # answers "is my phone still signed in", and a restart is a hard revoke
    # needing no recorded state. The peer pin, the revocation counter and
    # `kirocrew logout` all still apply unchanged.
    #
    # Opt out — ``no_refresh``: no refresh chain is issued at the exchange, so
    # ``session_exp`` becomes a real ceiling and the phone re-scans when it
    # lapses. Kept as a supported shape for an operator who wants the credential
    # bounded by a clock regardless of process lifetime.
    #
    # Mutually exclusive as the DEFAULT shapes on purpose: choosing both for an
    # unbounded caller would mean a session that neither refreshes nor lasts,
    # which is worse than either. A BOUNDED caller is different — its carried
    # claims are merged over the configured shape below, and a token carrying
    # both ``boot`` and ``no_refresh`` is then the honest intersection: the
    # session ends at whichever bound is hit first, which is exactly what
    # "never out-scope the caller" requires.
    #
    # The TTL clamp above is untouched under both shapes. Rotation is what
    # extends a boot-bound session, so no ceiling and no security constant moves.
    # Read the session-shape choice here rather than widening ``_live_state``'s
    # tuple, which the status endpoint also consumes.
    #
    # An unreadable config falls back to the DEFAULT, not to the other shape.
    # "We could not read your override, so use the default" is the honest
    # reading; picking the timed shape instead would hand the phone a session
    # that expires on a clock the operator did not ask for, which presents as a
    # phone that randomly signs itself out. The fallback is not unbounded
    # either — a boot-bound session still ends at the next restart.
    # Read INDEPENDENTLY, each with its own conservative default, rather than as
    # one all-or-nothing block. Coupling them means a config object missing any
    # ONE attribute discards the other two — so adding this shape would silently
    # take the existing opt-out away from anyone whose config predates it, which
