"""Computer-use REST API — Settings → Computer Use, plus the loopback legs.

Four endpoints, two very different trust models:

``GET  /api/computer-use/config``  browser-called, cookie-authed
``PUT  /api/computer-use/config``  browser-called, cookie-authed
``POST /api/computer-use/invoke``  MACHINE-only (loopback + ``X-Internal-Secret``)
``POST /api/computer-use/frame``   MACHINE-only (loopback), live-view frame ingress

The config pair is the operator's own out-of-band control surface. It reports the
keystone primary enable, the ``config.json`` budget knobs, the ADVISORY macOS
permission rows, the read-only built-in denylist, and a governance summary; the
PUT writes the enable to the KEYSTONE and the budgets to ``config.json``. Because
this handler is the ONLY writer of the primary enable, and because it does not
route through the agent tool gate, it is what makes "the agent cannot turn its own
desktop automation on" true.

``POST /api/computer-use/invoke`` is the other half of the thin-shim architecture:
the ``kirocrew-computer`` stdio MCP process does no accessibility work and no
governance evaluation — it resolves its session identity strictly and forwards
here, so the authoritative fail-CLOSED gate, all native work and all SEL auditing
happen in the gateway. It is registered in ``server._STRICT_INTERNAL_API_PATHS``
(loopback + secret, no cookie fall-through) because no browser ever calls it.

``POST /api/computer-use/frame`` is the live-view (PiP) frame ingress. It carries
NO new capture: the capture layer relays the JPEG it already encoded for the
model, and this handler only rebroadcasts it over the existing websocket. The
three suppressions that make a pixel egress path acceptable (an unattributable
capture, a window holding a secure field, and a withheld screenshot channel) are
all enforced BEFORE the POST, in
``computer_use/screencast.py`` — this handler's own job is the loopback gate, the
field bounds, and the OWNER-only rebroadcast. See :func:`api_computer_use_frame`.

Blocking work is offloaded: the keystone/config reads and the governance profile
walk touch the filesystem, the permission probe SHELLS OUT to
``kirocrew computer doctor --json`` rather than calling ctypes in-process (a
ctypes fault is not catchable in Python and would take the whole gateway — every
chat session, the cron scheduler, the Slack socket — down with it), and the
dispatch itself performs accessibility calls that block for tens of milliseconds.
None of it may run on the event loop.

Two DIFFERENT pools, and the split matters: the config reads/writes use the default
executor (short, bounded filesystem work), while the dispatch uses
``executors.subprocess_executor`` — the bounded pool reserved for calls that can
block on a wedged external resource, which is exactly a hung target application
parking a worker for the driver's whole messaging timeout. See
:func:`_dispatch_off_loop`.

    ``app_token_path_allowed``. This is the ONE write the keystone design exists to
    prevent — ``enable_state.save_state`` deliberately bypasses ``is_sensitive_path``
    (that is what lets the operator's own Settings panel write a file the agent
    cannot), so without this gate an agent that can author an app manifest could read
    its own ``.app_secret``, mint an app token and flip ``enabled: true`` on its own
    desktop automation. Same guard as ``handlers/kiro_prerequisite.py`` and
    ``handlers/messaging.py``'s notification push.

    **There is no governance ceiling on this route, and therefore no 409.** Computer
    use is one operator opt-in: ``SCOPE_CATALOG`` carries no ``computer_use*`` row, so
    there is nothing that can forbid a widening request (there is no ``status=409`` in
    this module) — see ``docs/system-specs/modules/governance.md`` for why computer
    use is deliberately ungoverned. Other outcomes: ``400`` for a malformed body or an
    out-of-range value, ``403`` for an app token (above), and ``500`` for a corrupt
    keystone or ``config.json``, which is left byte-identical rather than clobbered
    (``StateCorruptError``, the ``ConfigCorruptError`` precedent).

    """POST /api/computer-use/invoke — run one computer-use tool IN THE GATEWAY.

    MACHINE endpoint: the ``kirocrew-computer`` stdio MCP shim is the only caller,
    authenticated by loopback + ``X-Internal-Secret``. No browser calls it.

    The middleware listing (``server._STRICT_INTERNAL_API_PATHS``) is NOT sufficient
    on its own, so this handler re-asserts the machine grant itself. Being on the
    strict list does not mean "secret required": when the ``X-Internal-Secret``
    header is ABSENT, ``token_auth_middleware`` deliberately falls through to
    normal cookie auth so dashboard pages can call internal routes — and on a
    ``local_only=False`` deployment it reclassifies every strict path as "mixed"
    outright. Either way a caller holding only a valid dashboard cookie or an
    app-scoped token would reach this handler AND choose its own ``session_key``,
    which selects the governance profile — e.g. claiming ``dashboard:main`` to
    escape a ``cu-off-subagent`` profile. Requiring ``request["internal_auth"]``
    (set by the middleware ONLY after a constant-time ``X-Internal-Secret`` match)
    closes the cookie, app-token and non-local_only variants in one place,
    independent of how the route happens to be classified.

    Body: ``{"tool": "computer_click", "args": {...}, "session_key": "…",
    "agent": "…", "app": "…"}``. The reply is ``{"text": "…"}`` — the exact string
    the shim relays to the model, already gated, already shaped by the observation
    ceiling, already redacted. Failures are returned as that same ``Error: …``
    text with a 200 rather than a 5xx, because the shim's job is to relay a TOOL
    RESULT: a non-200 surfaces as a transport failure the model cannot reason
    about, whereas ``Error: …`` is what ``mcp_shared.call_tool_with_logging``
    classifies as a failed SEL outcome. Malformed requests (not from the real
    shim) still get 4xx.

    The identity fields are not an authorization claim this handler trusts: the
    ``session_key`` is resolved STRICTLY on the shim side (``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY``,
    else ``KIROCREW_HOST_PID`` + the HMAC sidecar), which refuses an unresolvable
    key before it reaches the wire. Passing them in the body is how the gateway
    learns which surface is calling — it is the AUDIT identity, not a permit; the
    trust comes from the local-secret handshake plus that strict resolution.

    ``approval_recorded`` is passed as ``False`` and does not change any outcome:
    nothing reads it. It is not minted from the request body, because a body field
    would be a claim the shim issues to itself.

    The dispatch is offloaded: accessibility and capture calls block for tens of
    milliseconds each and must not land on the event loop.

# ── POST /api/computer-use/frame — the live-view (PiP) frame ingress ──


async def api_computer_use_frame(request: web.Request) -> web.Response:
    """POST /api/computer-use/frame — rebroadcast one already-captured frame.

    MACHINE endpoint, LOOPBACK-gated exactly like ``api_browser_frame``: the only
    caller is this same gateway's capture thread (``computer_use/screencast.py``),
    and the body is a live view of the operator's own desktop, so an off-host POST
    is refused outright. The route is additionally in
    ``server._STRICT_INTERNAL_API_PATHS``, so the middleware requires the
    ``X-Internal-Secret``; the loopback check here is re-asserted rather than
    inherited, because a ``local_only=False`` deployment reclassifies strict paths
    as mixed and would otherwise admit a cookie-authenticated caller.

    **What this handler does NOT decide.** It is not the security boundary for the
    pixels. Every suppression is evaluated before the POST, next to the capture:

    * a snapshot whose window holds any secure (password) field is never mirrored
      — ``Snapshot.has_secure``, the driver's own predicate;
    * a withheld ``screenshot`` channel emits no frame — resolved through
      ``gate.permitted_observation_channels``, the same evaluator the tool path and
      the Settings snapshot use. It permits every channel today; the check is the
      seam, not a live restriction;
    * a capture with no published surface scope emits no frame, because a frame
      that cannot be attributed to a surface cannot be governed for one.

    Frames are the already-downscaled JPEGs the model itself received (1280px/q55
    by default); ``build_frame_payload`` refuses any other encoding, so a
    full-resolution PNG cannot travel this path.

    The rebroadcast is OWNER-only (``deliver_ws_owners``), not
    ``broadcast_ws``: an App Kit credential can open ``/api/ws`` and land in the
    all-clients set, and a live view of the operator's desktop must not cross that
    boundary. Awaited rather than fire-and-forget so the reply reflects delivery.
