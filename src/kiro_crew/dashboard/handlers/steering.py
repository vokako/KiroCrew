"""Kiro steering files API — list / read / create / update / delete.

Steering files are plain markdown documents that Kiro injects into every
session as always-on project or personal conventions.  Two locations are in
play, and they are loaded by two different mechanisms:

* ``~/.kiro/steering/**/*.md`` — **global** (``user`` source).  kiro-cli loads
  these for every session, and the dashboard's own CC-backend injection
  (:func:`kiro_crew.context._load_steering_resources`) globs the agent
  config's ``file://.kiro/steering/**/*.md`` resource against ``$HOME``, which
  resolves to exactly this directory.
* ``<project>/.kiro/steering/**/*.md`` — **workspace** (``workspace`` source).
  kiro-cli loads these because the session subprocess runs with the slot's
  project directory as its cwd.

These endpoints back the Steering tab under Agent Capabilities, surfacing which
steering documents are in effect.

Path handling mirrors the skills browser (``handlers/_shared.py``): traversal,
absolute paths, ``~`` expansion, non-``.md`` suffixes, symlinked intermediate
directories and sensitive locations are all rejected before any read or write.
A LEAF symlink is listed and readable — read-only — when its resolved target
passes the session loader's admission gate against the source's LINK trust
base (:func:`kiro_crew.context.steering_target_admissible`: ``$HOME`` for
``user``, the steering root itself for ``workspace`` — ``_link_trust_base``);
it never resolves for write.

    The read goes through ``hooks.safe_read_file_bytes_nolink()`` with
    ``within_root`` set to the steering root, which is what binds the bytes to
    the authorized location: the helper opens with ``O_NOFOLLOW``, ``fstat``s
    the descriptor (rejecting hardlinks and non-regular files), and then
    verifies the OPENED descriptor's real path resolves inside that root and is
    not sensitive. ``O_NOFOLLOW`` alone only guards the final path component,
    so without ``within_root`` an ancestor directory swapped for a symlink
    between resolution and open could still escape the tree.

    A LINKED entry (leaf symlink the listing admitted read-only) resolves to
    its target, which can sit outside the steering root — that read is bound
    to the source's LINK trust base instead (``$HOME`` for ``user``, the
    steering root itself for ``workspace`` — ``_link_trust_base``), the same
    anchor ``steering_target_admissible`` admits the target against. The
    descriptor checks still apply to the inode actually opened, so a link
    retargeted after resolution can reach nothing outside the base the
    listing admitted from.

    The ``lstat`` below only supplies the size for the 413 message; the file
    can still grow past the cap before the descriptor read, in which case the
    helper raises ``FileTooLargeError`` — caught here so that race yields 413
