    """Read and parse a JSON *object* request body, capped at *max_bytes*.

    Returns ``(body, None)`` on success, or ``(None, error_response)`` when the
    caller should return early. This owns the parse-and-shape guard for the
    endpoints routed through it: ``await request.json()`` happily returns a
    list, string, or number for a body that is valid JSON but not an object, and
    a handler that then calls ``.get()`` on the result turns a client mistake
    into a 500.

    NOT yet the dashboard's only such guard. Four siblings survive and diverge:
    ``handlers_channel._json_object`` (same ``invalid_json``/``body_not_object``
    codes, but raises ``HTTPBadRequest`` instead of returning the response),
    ``handlers/hooks.py::_json_object`` (``default_empty=True`` collapses a
    MALFORMED body to defaults), ``handlers/session_storage.py::_json_body``
    (deliberately different: an empty body is legitimate there, and it
    documents why), and ``handlers/artifacts.py::_read_json_body`` (raises
    ``ArtifactValidationError``, carries its own cap). Folding or narrowing each
    is still outstanding -- claiming one owner before that is done would be a
    claim the tree does not support.

    The cap is enforced BEFORE decoding: a Content-Length precheck rejects an
    oversized declared body, and the stream is then read incrementally so a
    chunked body (which carries no Content-Length) cannot buffer past
    ``max_bytes + one chunk`` on the event-loop thread. That bound is the point
    of the helper for the strict-internal notification routes.

    ``max_bytes=None`` reads the body whole with no pre-decode ceiling, for the
    endpoints that have no principled byte limit today (a knowledge bundle
    import has no defensible maximum size). It is deliberately explicit rather
    than the default: an endpoint opting out of the cap should say so at the
    call site, and giving one of those endpoints a real ceiling later is then a
    one-argument change here instead of a re-plumb.

    Which one a converting caller wants is a real choice, not a default to
    inherit: take the cap when the body is a fixed set of control fields (an
    identifier, a flag, a number), and ``None`` only when the body legitimately
    carries user content of unbounded size (file contents, an export, a fetched
    document). Note that switching a site TO the cap also moves it off
    ``request.json()`` onto the streaming read, so that handler's unit tests
    must feed ``content``/``content_length`` rather than mocking ``json``.

    *allow_absent* treats a request with no readable body as an empty object,
    for endpoints whose fields all have defaults. A body that is *present but
    malformed* is still a 400 -- "the client sent nothing" and "the client sent
    garbage" are different facts, and only the first one can be defaulted.

    Decoding matches ``request.json()`` on both paths -- ``decode(charset or
    utf-8)`` then ``loads`` -- so the two differ only in whether the read is
    bounded, and the declared ``charset=`` is honoured either way. The uncapped
    path calls ``request.json()`` itself rather than reimplementing it, which is
    what makes converting a ``try: await request.json()`` site a drop-in: no
    handler and no test harness sees a different read.

    The catch is narrowed to the three client-input failures -- ``ValueError``
    (which covers ``json.JSONDecodeError`` and ``UnicodeDecodeError``),
    ``LookupError`` (an unknown ``charset=`` codec), and ``RecursionError`` (a
    deeply nested document blowing the parser's stack). Transport failures (a
    disconnect mid-body, a read timeout) deliberately propagate: they are not a
    client JSON mistake and keep their 500 status class.

    credential must never out-scope the session authorizing it.

    Returns ``(carried_claims, ttl_ceiling_seconds)``. ``ttl_ceiling`` is ``0``
    when the caller has no lifetime left to lend, which the handler refuses
    rather than minting against. Claims are carried, never re-derived: ``boot``
    copied verbatim (same rule as the link→session exchange in ``token_auth``),
    ``no_refresh`` copied so the recipient session never grows a refresh chain,
    and the remaining ``session_exp`` becomes the TTL ceiling so a short-lived
    caller cannot mint a longer-lived credential. ``require_peer`` and its
    signed ``peer_key`` move as one inseparable device bound. Fail-closed on an
    unreadable payload: a caller whose bounds cannot be established gets a
    bounded (no-refresh, default-TTL-capped) link rather than an unbounded one.

    **Read the credential the middleware VALIDATED, not a re-extracted one.**
    Only that credential has a verified signature; the other one was never
    checked. ``token_auth`` publishes it as ``request["auth_token"]`` for
    exactly this reason: its own extraction prefers ``?token=`` but falls back
    to the session cookie when the query token is invalid, so re-deriving with
    a fixed query-then-cookie order could pick the credential that was NOT
    validated — letting a request that authenticated with a bounded cookie have
    its bounds read from an unverified, attacker-settable query token, dropping
    ``no_refresh`` and raising the TTL ceiling to the full maximum, which is
    precisely the ceiling-escape this function exists to prevent. When no
    credential was published (a surface that authenticated by another means),
    the mint is bounded fail-closed the same way an unreadable payload is.

    **A non-positive remaining lifetime is never rounded up.** Clamping it to a
    floor of one second would let a caller whose own session has just run out
    mint a link that outlives it, and the exchange the recipient performs starts
    a fresh window — so repeating the mint would walk the expiry forward
    indefinitely from a session that should already be dead. Report ``0`` and

      is reported as ``"persistent"``: the field postdates the feature, so a
      valid header without it is genuinely a legacy persistent session.
    * ``None`` — **unknown**. No file, or no parseable metadata object as the
      first line. Callers gating memory writes MUST deny on ``None`` rather
      than treat it as persistent. Denying is safe: ``ConversationLog.append``
      writes the metadata line when it creates the file, before any message is
      appended, so a session file whose first line is not metadata was not
      produced by a normal session and is no evidence that writes are allowed.

    This is the recovery path for a session whose in-memory state is gone but
    whose transcript is still on disk. Both in-memory signals a restricted
    session normally carries are dropped when a tab is archived
    (``api_chat_slot_close`` removes the slot from ``state._slots`` *and*
    discards its key from ``state._restricted_keys``), while the transcript —
    including its ``memory_mode`` marker — persists. Without reading that
    marker back, an archived incognito session whose MCP subprocess is still
    alive presents as an ordinary established session and its memory writes
    are allowed.

    Only the FIRST line is consulted, and only ``_METADATA_HEAD_MAX_BYTES`` of
    it: a later ``_type: metadata`` object is message content, not the header,
    and must not be able to redefine the mode. Byte-bounding keeps an enormous
    or adversarial first line from pinning memory.
