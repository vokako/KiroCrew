"""Serve model-authored HTML to a sandboxed iframe from a real URL.

Two dashboard surfaces render HTML the model wrote — saved artifacts
(``ArtifactBody``) and inline chat widgets (``WidgetFrame``) — and neither may
hand the frame a ``blob:`` URL built in the browser: that works in Chromium and
fails in some WebKit-based in-app browsers, which refuse the load outright
("invalid url or response") and can take the whole page down with it. ``srcdoc``
is not the way out either: a sandboxed ``srcdoc`` frame blank-renders on WebKit.
A plain ``https`` document is the only form observed to load everywhere.

The bytes are already in the browser, so this is deliberately a STASH rather than
a per-source reader: the caller POSTs the html it already holds and gets back a
short-lived URL. One mechanism then covers both surfaces — and the inline-widget
case, whose bytes are not persisted anywhere and so have no other URL to give.

Security posture, mirroring the webapp-preview channel next door:

* The GET route is on the auth-middleware bypass list, and the **HMAC path token
  IS the credential**. It is bound to the requesting client address, because the
  token rides in the frame's own location where model-authored script can read
  it — an exfiltrated token is useless from another connection.
* ``Content-Security-Policy: sandbox`` makes the response an opaque origin
  **even when opened top-level**, so the URL existing on the dashboard's own
  origin does not turn model HTML into same-origin script. The sandbox flags
  match what the embedding iframes already grant, so nothing the frame could do
  before is newly permitted or newly denied. ``frame-ancestors`` on the same
  response is ``'self'`` plus the ancestors ``'self'`` cannot express — see
  ``origin.frame_ancestors_value`` for why both halves are load-bearing.
* Every authorization decision is SEL-audited, rejected probes included. The
  token itself is never logged.
* Entries expire, are capped in count and size, and are evicted oldest-first, so
  a long dashboard session cannot grow the stash without bound.

    oracle for which ids exist.

    **Single use.** The entry is popped before the body is written, so a URL that
    leaks is already spent: the frame it was minted for consumed it. This is the
    load-bearing control rather than the client binding below, because
    ``request.remote`` is the PROXY's address whenever the dashboard is reached
    through one (a tunnel, a reverse proxy), and every client then shares it — the
    binding is worth nothing in exactly the deployments where a URL is most
    reachable. The binding stays as a second, cheap layer for the direct case.

    The cost is that a frame the BROWSER reloads on its own (rather than a page
    reload, which remounts the app and mints again) finds its document spent and
    gets this 404 inside the frame. Nothing in the frontend observes the GET —
    the document is served with an opaque origin, so the parent cannot read
    whether it loaded — and the retry control appears only when the MINT itself
    fails. Recovering a spent URL therefore needs a page reload. Detecting it
    would take a beacon injected into the document plus a deadline, which is
    not built; do not describe one here until it is.
