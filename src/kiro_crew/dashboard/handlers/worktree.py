"""Git worktree creation for the follow-up card's "Start in new worktree" action.

One endpoint, ``POST /api/worktree/create``, which creates a sibling worktree of
an existing local git repository on a new branch. The follow-up card calls it
before opening a new chat session scoped to the resulting directory.

Threat model. Both inputs are attacker-influenceable in the sense that matters
here: ``branch`` originates from an LLM (``suggest_followup``) and ``repo`` from
whatever the calling session's project happens to be. So:

* git is invoked with an **argv list and no shell** — there is no command string
  for a metacharacter to escape from — with a credential-scrubbed environment,
  the POSIX resource-limit ceiling, and a wall-clock timeout.
* ``repo`` must resolve inside a directory some existing chat slot is already
  scoped to (:func:`_allowed_repo_roots`). Without that barrier any
  authenticated dashboard caller could name an arbitrary host directory.
  Both the submitted path AND the git toplevel it resolves to are checked, so
  resolving upward out of an allowed subdirectory is refused.

Why the git spawn is sandbox-routed
-----------------------------------
:func:`_run_git` goes through the ``sandboxed_spawn_argv`` chokepoint (OS
isolation + credential-scrubbed env), matching ``git_coord.py``'s treatment of
agent-influenced git. A host with no sandbox backend and no explicit
``agent.sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec`` opt-in gets a 503 rather than an
unisolated spawn.

The repo-supplied-code guards sit ON TOP of that, because isolation bounds what
a hook can reach but does not stop it running:

* ``git worktree add`` would otherwise run the repo's ``post-checkout`` hook or
  an ``core.fsmonitor`` command; both are removed by the ``-c`` overrides in
  :func:`_git_no_repo_code`, which beat every config file. ``core.hooksPath``
  points at :data:`_HOOKS_SINK` (``os.devnull``) — a non-directory OS device, so
  there is no ``post-checkout`` to find and no directory anyone could plant one
  in.
* A ``filter.<name>.process``/``.smudge`` driver cannot be disabled generically
  (driver names are arbitrary), so a repo declaring one in EITHER repository
  config scope is refused instead (:func:`_checkout_filter`).

Concurrency
-----------
The branch is claimed atomically with ``update-ref <ref> <base> ""`` (empty old
value = "must not exist") BEFORE anything is created, so two concurrent requests
for the same branch are decided by git's ref lock and only the winner proceeds.
Cleanup removes only what a request can prove it created — the branch only if it
won the claim, the destination only if git registers it against that same branch
(or against nothing, under the per-repo lock). Same-repo requests are also
serialized in-process by :func:`_repo_lock`.

Other input protections
-----------------------
* ``branch`` must satisfy :func:`~kiro_crew.validation.is_valid_followup_branch`,
  which excludes a leading ``-`` (git would read it as a flag), ``..``, ``~``,
  ``^``, ``:``, ``?``, ``*``, ``[``, ``\\`` and whitespace.
* ``repo`` is realpath'd, must be a directory, must not be a sensitive path, and
  must resolve to a git work tree whose **toplevel** is used thereafter — a path
  pointing anywhere inside a repo cannot be used to make git operate on a parent
  it does not control.
* The destination is *derived* by this module (never supplied by the caller) and
  must not already exist, so the endpoint cannot be aimed at an existing tree.
