    replace would leave a multi-colon channel key like
    ``discord:kirocrew:direct:123`` mapped to a stem that does not exist.

    Both candidates are included because a slot's write target and its DISPLAY
    source can differ: a channel tab the dashboard could not bind runs under
    ``dashboard:<stem>`` while the conversation on screen lives in the channel
    transcript. Choosing between them would make the answer depend on provenance
    resolving correctly, and provenance is exactly what a legacy transcript

    Exactly two reasons, and the narrowness is the design:

    ``"user"``
        The End-wait button parked an explicit request naming this ``wait_id``.

    ``"steer"``
        A mid-turn steer reached the backend AFTER this sleep began. kiro-cli
        can only inject a steer at a model-inference boundary and an in-flight
        tool call is the absence of one, so without this the user's correction
        sits in the backend's steer queue until the sleep elapses — up to the
        tool's 1800s ceiling — while the agent sleeps through it.

    "After this sleep began" is decided by comparing the provider's steer stamp
    against the reading taken when this sleep was minted, so the handler reads
    no clock of its own: the only two values ever compared are two readings of
    the same monotonic source. That is deliberate — a wall-clock stamp on one
    side and a monotonic one on the other is how a suspend silently reorders
    the comparison.

    Re-taking the baseline at every mint is also what makes the reason fire
    once. A steer the backend has accepted but not yet injected stays newer
    than nothing at all, so without a per-sleep baseline it would end sleep
    after sleep for the rest of the turn and hand the model a `wait` that
    returns instantly.

    Not extended to the other long block on this route. ``spawn_sub_agents``
    can wait 7200s on live sub-agents and pings the same endpoint, but sends no
    ``wait_id`` and so never reaches this decision — an exclusion worth keeping
    deliberately: ending a sleep discards nothing, while cutting a sub-agent
    collection short orphans work that keeps running with nobody left to read
