"""Session tags — dynamic vocabulary CRUD, slot assignment, and sidebar columns.

Tags are user-defined labels (id/name/color/status) attached to dashboard chat
slots. Sessions can carry multiple tags. The sidebar renders as a horizontal
strip of user-configurable columns. A column filters either by a set of tags
(any/all/none mode) or by the session's live runtime lane — needs-approval,
waiting, working, idle — which is derived from the slot payload rather than
stored on the session. Dragging a session card between columns that carry a
single status tag as filter reassigns the card's status tag; a derived state
lane refuses the drop, because only the agent's own progress moves a card there.

    The definition of "a folder tag id a new chat may inherit" for the
    folder/inheritance paths, shared by the dashboard slot-create path
    (chat_handlers), the folder create/PATCH validation (chat_folders), the
    channel first-filing path, and the channel restore read (channel_slots)
    so an inheritance-rule change cannot land on one path and miss the
    others. (Three pre-existing slot-restore prunes elsewhere apply the same
    shape guards inline, and ``api_chat_slot_tags``'s strict inline filter is
    a fourth spelling differing only on the fail-open axis; consolidating all
    four onto this helper — likely via a strict-mode flag — is deliberately
    left to a follow-up. Those sites are outside this change.)
    Callers must invoke it AT THE POINT OF APPLICATION (immediately before the
    ids are written to a slot or persisted), never on a value resolved
    earlier — a tag deletion between resolve and apply would otherwise
    resurrect the deleted id.

    Two guard tiers, deliberately different in when they apply:

    * UNCONDITIONAL shape guards — ``raw`` must be a list (``folders.json``
      is hand-editable; anything else yields ``[]``), and each entry must be
      a string BEFORE the membership test (a non-string entry is unhashable
      and the test itself would raise, turning a malformed store row into a
      500 on every chat created in that folder). Order-preserving,
      de-duplicated.
    * AUTHORITY-GATED vocabulary intersection — ids are checked against the
      live vocabulary (``state._tags``) only when it is authoritative,
      mirroring the three sibling restore paths (``_tags_authoritative`` is
      False when ``tags.json`` was unreadable at boot). Failing OPEN there is
      load-bearing: intersecting with an unknown (empty) vocabulary would
      drop every id, the next save would persist the loss, and the sticky
      filing marker would block re-inheritance forever. A dangling id kept
      this way is pruned by the restore paths on the next authoritative boot.

    Non-status tags are preserved. Any other configuration is a no-op so users
    can have filter-only columns without accidental data loss. A derived state
    lane is refused outright — its membership follows the session's runtime
    state and no tag write can place a card there.
