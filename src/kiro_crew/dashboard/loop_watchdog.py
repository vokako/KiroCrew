"""Off-loop watchdog that turns an event-loop stall into a logged stack dump.

KiroCrew's gateway runs the dashboard HTTP server, every agent turn, and all
background tasks on a *single* asyncio event loop on *one* thread.  If a
coroutine performs a blocking syscall on that thread — e.g. an un-timed-out
socket ``close()`` while tearing down a half-dead ACP/model stream, or a burst
of ``os.waitpid()`` reaping many kiro-cli children at once — the whole loop
wedges:

* the HTTP server stops answering (``/api/status`` is itself a coroutine on the
  wedged loop, so it cannot even report "I'm sick" — it just hangs);
* the async event-loop heartbeat can no longer be scheduled, so the log goes
  **silent**; and
* that silence is the only signal, and it carries no information about *where*
  the loop is stuck.

Two independent mechanisms turn that silence into an actionable artifact, both
fed by the async heartbeat calling :meth:`LoopStallWatchdog.beat` every tick:

1. **Authoritative dump-then-exit (the primary, portable path).**  Each beat
   re-arms :func:`faulthandler.dump_traceback_later` with ``exit=True``.  That
   timer lives on faulthandler's own C thread and reads thread states in C, so
   it fires even when the loop thread is wedged in a syscall *and* the
   GIL-dependent daemon check below would be starved; when it fires it dumps
   *all* thread stacks and then ``_exit()``s the process in one atomic step.
   The mechanism is fully cross-platform and needs no root — unlike an
   out-of-process ``py-spy`` capture, which macOS blocks without elevated
   ``task_for_pid`` privileges. Desktop launches use a 25s exit budget near
   Electron's independent liveness window. Managed services have no Electron
   probe, use a wider budget, and receive the soft diagnostic dump first.

   **Journal visibility:** hard-exit dumps land in the dedicated file only (not
   stderr/journal) because ``faulthandler.dump_traceback_later`` targets a single
   fd.  On the next gateway startup, ``server.py`` detects and replays the dump
   content to the logger at WARNING level (capped at 120 lines / 8 KB), so
   journal-only operators (containers, ``journalctl``) see the stacks one restart
   later — exactly when they are investigating why the gateway died.

2. **Soft observability dump (the daemon-thread fallback).**  A separate daemon
   thread compares the last beat against the clock and, once the loop has not
   beaten for ``stall_after`` seconds, logs a marker and dumps all thread stacks
   *without* exiting, re-arming on recovery. When the hard timer is active this
   stays on stderr so a recovered stall is not classified as a fatal crash. If
   the hard timer is disabled or could not be armed, the soft dump also goes to
   the dedicated file because no later fatal capture can make it discoverable.

The daemon thread keeps running even when the loop thread is blocked in the
kernel — CPython releases the GIL around blocking syscalls such as ``close()`` /
``waitpid()``, which is exactly the class of wedge observed in production.

The class is deliberately split so the decision logic (:meth:`check`) is a
pure, synchronous step that can be driven from tests with an injected clock and
dump callback, and the armed-timer arm/cancel calls are injectable too — so
tests verify the wiring without ever arming a real process-killing timer.

class LoopStallWatchdog:
    """Detects a wedged asyncio loop and captures the frozen stacks.

    Two layers, both fed by :meth:`beat` (called from the async heartbeat):

    * the C-level ``faulthandler`` armed timer that dumps **and exits** at
      ``exit_after`` seconds of silence — authoritative and portable / no-root;
      and
    * the daemon-thread :meth:`check` that dumps **without** exiting at
      ``stall_after`` seconds — a soft observability fallback.

    When ``exit_after`` is below ``stall_after`` (the desktop default), the
    armed timer exits before the soft threshold. When it is above
    ``stall_after`` (the managed-service default), the soft dump records the
    transient stall and the hard timer exits only if recovery never arrives.

    Args:
        stall_after: Seconds of heartbeat silence before the soft daemon-thread
            dump fires. Should comfortably exceed the heartbeat interval
            (default heartbeat is 5s, so 30s ≈ 6 missed ticks avoids false
            positives).
        exit_after: Seconds of silence before the authoritative
            ``dump_traceback_later(exit=True)`` fires.  The timer is re-armed
            only on each :meth:`beat`, so the real silence tolerated before
            ``_exit`` is ``exit_after`` minus up to one heartbeat interval.
            ``None`` disables the armed timer (only the soft dump remains).
        poll_interval: How often the daemon thread evaluates liveness.
        now: Monotonic clock, injectable for tests.
        dump: Soft stack-dump callback, injectable for tests. By default a
            soft dump is stderr-only while the hard timer is armed, otherwise
            it is written to both ``dump_file`` and stderr.
        arm_later: Arms the C-level dump-then-exit timer for N seconds,
            injectable for tests so they never arm a real process-killing timer.
            Defaults to :func:`_default_arm_later`.
        cancel_later: Cancels the armed timer, injectable for tests.  Defaults
            to :func:`_default_cancel_later`.
        enrich_after: Seconds of heartbeat silence before the daemon thread
            emits stall enrichment (stall UTC timestamp + this process's
            established TCP sockets with rx/tx queue depths) to the logger at
            WARNING.  Must sit below ``exit_after`` so the capture lands
            *before* the armed timer's dump-then-exit — with the 5s poll
            cadence, 15s triggers on the 15–20s tick, ahead of the 25s exit.
            Never written into ``dump_file``: that file is the boot-time
            crash sentinel (line-count classified), so an append would make a
            recovered stall read as a fatal crash on the next startup.  Both
            production stalls to date froze the loop inside websocket frame
            parsing; this records *which* socket without needing a repro.
        enrich: Enrichment collector ``silence_secs -> lines``, injectable for
            tests.  Defaults to
            :func:`kiro_crew.dashboard.stall_enrichment.collect_stall_enrichment`.
