    """Return ``(cron_count, lesson_count, error)`` loaded OFF the event loop.

    ``DashboardState._count_lessons()`` performs blocking I/O on two stores:
    the JSONL file (``stat()`` + ``read_text()`` via ``load_all``) PLUS a
    SQLite ``COUNT(*)`` via ``VectorMemoryStore.count_lessons`` (serialized on
    the shared connection through ``_fetch_all_locked``, documented as
    executor-thread safe). The cron count comes from a direct read-only parse
    of ``crons.json`` (``count_enabled_from_disk``). The WS status pusher runs
    on the event loop, so computing these inline would stall the loop — and
    with it EVERY other WebSocket / coroutine on the gateway — for the
    duration of that disk latency (seconds on a slow/large home dir or a
    contended NFS mount). Offload both to a worker thread so the loop stays
    responsive; the pusher is a periodic background task, so the extra thread
    hop is free.

    The lesson count MUST come from ``_count_lessons`` (JSONL + vector store),
    the same total ``/api/status`` and the SSE updates path report via
    ``status_snapshot``'s default (those two callers still compute it inline
    on the loop; only this path offloads). Counting only ``lessons.load_all()``
    here would let the pusher's cached value override the correct default with
    the JSONL-only half, so the Overview card would show 0 on hosts whose
    lessons live in the vector store.

    Each count is guarded INDEPENDENTLY: on failure that component falls back
    to its ``fallback`` half while the other keeps its fresh value — the
    vector-store read can surface ``sqlite3.OperationalError`` (busy timeout,
    disk I/O) or ``RuntimeError`` (store not initialized), and an exception
    escaping into ``_push_status``'s loop would silently end that connection's
    status frames, losing the version/liveness signal until a page reload. A
    lessons failure must not also discard a successfully-read cron count.
    ``None`` means UNKNOWN, never 0: the pusher seeds its cache with ``None``
    so a component that has never refreshed successfully is published as
    ``null`` (the dashboard renders a loading skeleton) instead of an
    authoritative-looking 0. ``error``
    joins each failed component's exception TYPE name (``None`` on full
    success) so the operator-visible warning can name the cause without
    leaking store paths (``str(OSError)`` embeds its filename); it never
    enters the WS frame. The guards catch ``Exception`` only, so
    ``asyncio.CancelledError`` (a ``BaseException``) propagates out of THIS
    helper uncaught — that is this function's contract; the pusher's own
    outer handler decides its task's teardown semantics.

    NOTE: this deliberately uses ``count_enabled_from_disk`` rather than
    ``list_jobs``. ``list_jobs`` calls ``_sync()`` → ``_load()`` → ``_arm_timer()``,
    and ``_arm_timer`` calls ``asyncio.create_task`` — with no running loop in a
    worker thread that raises ``RuntimeError``, and since ``_arm_timer`` cancels
    the existing timer first it would silently stop all scheduled cron jobs.
    ``count_enabled_from_disk`` is a pure read that never mutates loop-owned
    state or the timer, so it is safe off-thread.
