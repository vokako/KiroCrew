"""Stream one multipart part to disk without ever publishing a partial file.

Three handlers write an uploaded part to a temp file: composer uploads
(``handlers/files.py``), state import (``handlers/portability.py``) and knowledge
ingest (``handlers/knowledge.py``). They share this one implementation because
every way of getting it wrong is a variation on the same thing: a coroutine
owning a file it can be cancelled away from.

The failure modes, because the invariant is only legible next to what it
prevents:

1. An ignored ``os.write`` short count -- a truncated file that looks complete.
2. ``CancelledError`` derives from ``BaseException``, so ``except Exception``
   lets a gateway shutdown past every cleanup.
3. Cancellation racing ``to_thread(open)`` -- the worker creates the file
   *after* cleanup has run.
4. A cleanup callback registered before the shielded await, so the descriptor
   is closed before the coroutine resumes: ``EBADF`` on every upload.
5. ``close``/``unlink`` running on the serving loop; and a double close by
   descriptor *number* hitting a number the kernel has reassigned.
6. Cleanup keyed on ``task.result()`` cannot run for a directly cancelled open
   task -- the one case that needs it.
7. Cleanup keyed on the path instead races the worker the other way: the
   callback fires on cancellation and unlinks *before* the worker creates.

**The invariant.** A cancellable owner cannot both offload its cleanup and
guarantee it: offloading needs an await or a callback, and each introduces an
ordering the owner does not control -- which is precisely how (3), (6) and (7)
arise, in both directions. So ownership lives in a **synchronous context
manager**: ``__enter__`` creates, ``__exit__`` discards unless the body
committed. ``with`` guarantees ``__exit__`` on every exit including
``CancelledError``, and because no ``await`` sits between the create and the
cleanup's registration, nothing can race it and no result has to be fetched from
a task that may never produce one.

The deliberate cost, stated plainly rather than hidden: ``__enter__``'s single
``os.open`` and ``__exit__``'s single ``close``+``unlink`` run on the event loop.
That is bounded work on one freshly-named local path -- microseconds -- and it
buys an ordering guarantee that no off-loop arrangement provides. The *bulk*
cleanup of (5) -- a request unlinking up to 20 published paths, a 512 MB video
among them -- still runs in a worker, at the caller's level. Writes, the commit, and the sniff all run in workers too: only
the create/discard of one temp is on the loop, and only because correctness
requires it.

Two further properties the callers rely on:

* **Atomic publish.** ``dest`` is created solely by ``os.replace`` from a
  fully-written temp, so no failure path can leave anything at ``dest`` that
  looks complete. A reader either sees no file or sees all of it.
* **Sniff before disk.** The signature check runs on the first
  ``SNIFF_BYTES`` while they are still buffered in memory, so content that
  fails it never reaches the filesystem at all (CWE-434).
