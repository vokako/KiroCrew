"""Shared bounding helpers for append-only JSONL logs — on write and on read.

Several long-lived JSONL logs (the MCP stub's fallback audit log, the
subagents' slow-command log, per-member activity logs) grow one appended
record at a time from writers that must never stall an event loop. Each
needs the same bound: once the live file reaches its cap, rename it to a
single ``.1`` generation — O(1), no whole-file read — so total disk stays
at roughly twice the cap while one generation of history is kept.

:func:`rotate_jsonl_at` owns that rotation step. Each call site keeps its
own append, record shape, size cap, and error contract, because those
differ per log; what they share is exactly the rotate-by-rename.

:func:`bounded_records` and :func:`strict_records` own the matching bound on
the READ side. A file's total size being rotated does not bound one RECORD:
``for line in handle`` asks for bytes up to the next newline, so a single
crafted newline-free line is one allocation the size of the whole file, and
every tree these readers touch is agent-writable. The two functions differ
only in the posture an over-cap record takes, which is a per-call-site
judgement and the reason both exist:

* :func:`bounded_records` SKIPS the record. Correct where the read is
  read-only and degradable — the caller already tolerates a malformed
  record, and dropping one costs a count, not durable state.
* :func:`strict_records` ABORTS the read. Correct where the parsed output
  feeds a rewrite or any other durable decision, because a silently
  skipped record there loses or duplicates data.

The two postures differ in exactly one more thing than the over-cap branch,
and that is the point rather than an accident. A skip reader only has to be
good enough to count with, so it decodes with ``errors="replace"``. A strict
reader's caller PERSISTS what it read, which that is not good enough for: a
replacement character would be written back in place of the original bytes.
The strict readers therefore make one guarantee — a record they yield is
exactly the record on disk — and raise :class:`UnreadableRecord` for every
other outcome.

Record BOUNDARIES are shared, and are the universal-newline set: ``\\n``,
``\\r\\n`` and a bare ``\\r`` all end a record, matching the text-mode reads
these callers were converted from. Splitting only on ``\\n`` would glue a
CR-delimited pair into one line that parses as neither record, which costs a
skip reader a count but costs a strict caller its correctness — a dedupe probe
stops seeing a prior entry.

Each has an undecoded twin — :func:`bounded_raw_records` and
:func:`strict_raw_records` — yielding ``bytes``. The bounded twin has one
caller, which already iterated a binary handle and prefilters on bytes before
parsing. The strict twin's caller is the snapshot notification merge, which
copies records into another file verbatim: it needs one guarantee the other
readers' callers do not, namely that the bytes are valid for the DESTINATION
file and not merely a faithful copy of the source. That is why it takes the raw
twin and validates the encoding itself rather than taking
:func:`strict_records`: a decode whose OUTPUT is what gets written back is the
non-byte-exact round trip that site is fixing. Its write-side contract is
stated on :func:`kiro_crew.snapshot._merge_notifications`.

:func:`kiro_crew.session_storage._manifest_records` is a third reader and
deliberately stays separate: it needs ``str.splitlines`` boundaries, since
it replaced a whole-file ``splitlines`` and a manifest split on any unicode
line boundary must keep parsing as it always did. The two readers here split
on the universal-newline set only, which is what the handle iteration they
replace
used.

# Longest record these readers will materialise, in BYTES (terminator excluded:
# the threshold applies to the record without its newline, so a cap-length record
# plus its terminator is accepted). Peak held is a carried tail plus one read and
# is flat in file size; MEASURED at 3.03x this value, which is parity with the
# reader in session_digest that this generalises. An earlier comment here said
# "roughly TWICE" and that was never true of either -- see _frames.
#
# The bound is in bytes, not characters, and callers open their file binary for
# that reason: a character cap is not a memory bound, because one astral code
# point is four bytes of `str` under PEP 393, so a 128 MiB CHARACTER cap admits
# half a gibibyte of resident text. Reading N bytes bounds the decoded `str` at a
# small constant multiple of N -- NOT at N exactly, because `errors="replace"`
# turns each undecodable byte into a U+FFFD costing 2 or 4 bytes of `str`
# depending on the widest code point in the record. That is still a bound flat in
# FILE size, which is the property the cap exists for, and it is why the peak is
# a constant multiple of this value rather than equal to it.
#
# One cap serves every caller, and it is sized for the LARGEST record shape any
# of them reads: a session transcript record, which carries a whole conversation
# turn. Its legitimate ceiling is ~90 MB -- image_artifacts'
# ``MAX_IMAGE_BYTES_PER_MESSAGE`` (64 MiB) base64-expands to ~85 MB, plus text --
# and the largest observed on a live install (30,351 kiro-cli logs, 27 GB) is
# 77,920,032 bytes, itself load-bearing: it carries an image content item, and the
# largest ``Prompt`` record (turns and first_message) is 56,203,168 bytes. 128 MiB
# is the smallest round value that clears that ceiling with margin.
#
# The other shapes read through here -- token-usage rows, telemetry export cycles,
# notification records, member activity entries (~150 bytes), stub fallback rows,
# cost samples -- are orders of magnitude smaller, so this cap never undercounts
# them either. A per-format cap would bound each tighter, but the memory that
# matters is the peak of one record, and a cap set below a format's real ceiling
# buys nothing while risking a silent undercount of legitimate data. This is why
# the cap is NOT session_storage's ``_MANIFEST_RECORD_CAP`` (8 MiB): a manifest
# record is a header or one session's file list, and 8 MiB here would silently
# truncate the biggest real sessions.

    FRAMING ONLY, and that separation is the point. This function owns the
    buffer, the record boundaries, and the cap as a memory bound; it decides
    nothing about what an over-cap record MEANS. The policy layers above it
    decide skip-versus-abort and never see a buffer, so a framing subtlety
    cannot turn into a policy bug.

    Reading framing state and policy state off the same raw buffer entangles the
    two, and the entanglement looks like separate bugs. A trailing
    ``\\r`` must be HELD rather than split (its ``\\n`` may be in the next
    read), and each way that goes wrong is that held byte interacting with a
    policy decision: counted as body, so an at-cap record is refused; carried
    into a read that completed it, so an over-cap record is admitted; and
    erased when dropping, so the next record's terminator ends the drop and a
    valid record vanishes. None of those is expressible here, because the only
    things that leave this function are a whole record and a marker.

    Two properties the callers depend on:

    - A record's body is measured when the record is COMPLETE, not per read. A
      record ending inside one read may have started in an earlier one, so a
      bounded ``readline`` bounds a read, not a record.
    - An over-cap record is dropped in full, including its terminator, so the
      next thing yielded always starts on a real boundary. Otherwise a hostile
      line's tail could forge a record that framing had just reported as
      dropped.

    Peak memory is MEASURED, not reasoned about: a plausible "roughly twice the
    cap" estimate is simply wrong -- for this reader and for the one it
    generalises. With ``tracemalloc`` at a 4 MiB
    cap: main's ``session_digest._bounded_lines`` peaks at 3.03x the cap, and so
    does this reader. It reached 4.03x while each read asked for a full ``cap``
    regardless of what the carried tail already held, which added a whole cap on
    top of a buffer that could already be that large; reads are now bounded by
    the remainder instead. The floor is a carried tail plus one read, and it is
    flat in file size, which is the property that actually matters.

    There is deliberately no ``drain`` switch. A caller that aborts simply
    stops consuming this generator, and generators are lazy, so the work of
    discarding a multi-GB tail is never done for it. That is the same guarantee
    the old explicit flag gave, with no flag to pass or get wrong.
