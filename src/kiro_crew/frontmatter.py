"""Single home for hand-rolled SKILL.md frontmatter parsing.

Four backend callers parse ``key: value`` frontmatter from markdown, and their
grammars differ: they
disagree on whether the opening fence may carry trailing text or leading
whitespace, whether an indented ``key: value`` line is a field or prose,
whether surrounding quotes are stripped from values, which of two duplicate
keys wins, and whether a YAML block-scalar value is resolved from its
indented continuation lines. Those disagreements are load-bearing — the
skills loader MUST keep rejecting indented keys (an indented occurrence
belongs to a block scalar, and honoring it once broke
``set_inject_on_trigger``), while the onboarding import screen MUST keep its
leniency (it is a fail-closed gate, and narrowing what it reads as
``always:``/``triggers:`` would turn refusals into acceptances). So the
scanner logic lives here exactly once, and each caller names its accepted
grammar explicitly via a :class:`FrontmatterDialect`. The skill-provider
preview (``dashboard/handlers/discover.py``) deliberately shares
:data:`SKILL_LOADER` rather than owning a dialect: what the preview shows
must match what the skills loader computes after install.

A FIFTH consumer lives outside Python and cannot be reached from this list by
import: the skill editor's frontmatter splicer
(``website/src/components/SkillForm.tsx``) MIRRORS :data:`SKILL_LOADER`'s
grammar in TypeScript, because it must never write a value this reader would
decode differently than it wrote it. ``readerCannotDecode`` and
``backendReadsValue`` there encode this dialect's quirks that matter to a
writer -- quote characters are stripped off both ends rather than unquoted, and
nothing is unescaped -- and its refusal rules are derived from them. That
mirror was measured against this module, not inferred, but nothing in the
build enforces it: change the quote handling, the block-scalar folding, or the
unescaping here and the editor will keep writing for the old dialect, which is
silent corruption of a user's skill file. Update that file in the same change,
and see ``test_frontmatter.py``'s corpus test for the pin that now fails when
a repo-tracked SKILL.md starts reading differently.

BLOCK SCALARS follow YAML: the full header grammar (explicit indentation
indicator, either modifier ordering, a trailing comment) is resolved by
:func:`parse_block_scalar_header`, and :func:`fold_block_scalar` honours real
chomping. That half of the dialect IS a YAML subset and is pinned differentially
against ``yaml`` in the tests.

PLAIN SCALARS are deliberately NOT YAML, and this is not a gap waiting to be
closed. This reader splits a field on its first colon and keeps the remainder
verbatim, so it accepts a value a YAML parser REFUSES OUTRIGHT -- an unquoted
``": "`` inside the text::

    description: Three capture backends: playwright-cli (the session ...)

A YAML parser rejects that document whole ("mapping values are not allowed
here"), not just the field. Two skills this repo SHIPS are written that way and
are read correctly only because of it:

- ``builtin_skills/kirocrew-dev/prepare-pr/SKILL.md``
- ``builtin_skills/web-verify/SKILL.md``

So the two accepted-input surfaces CROSS rather than nest, and swapping this
scanner for a YAML parse is not a strict improvement: measured over the 56
fenced repo-tracked SKILL.md files it would break those two outright.

    """Resolve a YAML block scalar's indented lines into a single value.

    ``indicator`` is a block-scalar header's style and chomping modifier (``|``,
    ``>-``, ``|+``, ...); ``block`` holds the raw continuation lines, still
    carrying their indentation. ``indent`` is the header's explicit indentation
    indicator when it declared one, and ``None`` when the content indentation is
    inferred from the first non-blank line.

    Literal (``|``) scalars keep one line per newline. Folded (``>``) scalars
    fold a single break between plain lines to a space and keep blank lines as
    newlines (k blanks -> k newlines plain-to-plain, k+1 next to a more-indented
    line, where the separator break stays literal), and never fold a break
    adjacent to a more-indented line, so nested indentation survives.

    Chomping follows YAML, and is the reason this function does not trim its
    result: ``-`` (strip) drops every trailing break, ``+`` (keep) preserves all
    of them, and the default (clip) keeps exactly one. A LEADING break is
    content under all three -- no chomping mode removes it -- so it is preserved
    too. A ``.strip()`` would do both, which would make agreement with a
    YAML parser depend on a block's content rather than on its header, and
    therefore force the skill editor to simulate this function and compare
    instead of reading the header.

    Note that EVERY line the frontmatter fence hands over is newline-terminated in
    the document: the fence's closing ``---`` sits on its own line, so the newline
    the extractor drops before it is the last content line's own terminator. The
    break count therefore always includes it. Feeding a YAML parser the captured
    text WITHOUT that newline is what makes the two look like they disagree here --
    reconstitute it and they do not.
