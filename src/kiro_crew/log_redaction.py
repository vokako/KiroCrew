"""Log redaction filter for secret values and Bearer tokens.

Intercepts log records at creation time via ``logging.setLogRecordFactory``,
ensuring ALL handlers (including those added after installation) see only
redacted output. This module performs ZERO vault I/O — the caller resolves
any literal secret values and passes them in via ``install_log_redaction``.

Currently the only caller (``cli._setup_cli_logging``) passes an empty list,
so the built-in patterns — Bearer tokens, AWS access key IDs, and standalone
JWTs — are what is redacted in practice. Wiring resolved
vault secret values into the filter at gateway boot is a follow-up.

Records are mutated only when redaction changes the rendered message — for
``msg``/``args`` whose args are exact immutable scalars (str/int/float/bool/
None, no subclasses) with clean text: a scalar's entire exportable surface IS
the string the scan inspects. Any opaque object arg disqualifies preservation
— its attributes can carry credentials a structured handler would serialize
but no text scan can bound. ``exc_info`` is ALWAYS rendered, redacted into
``exc_text``, and cleared: a live traceback is an object graph whose frames
carry locals no text scan can bound.

The trade this makes explicit: redaction inspects the RENDERED
text, never the internals of the ``args`` objects themselves, so a structured
handler that serializes arg objects directly (attribute dumps, JSON) can emit
content the text scan never saw. That limitation is inherent — the scan does not
look inside objects — and the alternative is destroying such records wholesale as
collateral. Preservation also moves rendering from creation time
to emit time: an arg object whose ``str()`` reads live state, or one mutated
before a ``QueueHandler`` drains, can emit text the creation-time scan never
saw. Both halves of the trade are accepted deliberately in favor of keeping
structured fields intact on the overwhelmingly common secretless record.

#:   twice. Resolved through a global, the same wrap made the wrapper its own base and
#:   every later record recursed until ``RecursionError`` — on a PROCESS-GLOBAL slot, so
#:   no record was emitted again, redacted or not.
#: * OWNERSHIP IS READ OFF THE SLOT. ``install``/``uninstall`` ask the installed object
