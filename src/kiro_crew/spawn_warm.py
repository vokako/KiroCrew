"""Agent-cache warming for spawn-shaped requests.

Lives here rather than in ``dashboard/handlers/messaging.py``, where it grew,
because both callers of it are not dashboard handlers: the ``POST /api/spawn``
endpoint and Crew dispatch. Keeping it in the handlers package forced Crew's
module to choose between a function-local import (against the repo's
``top-level-imports`` rule) and pulling the ENTIRE handler tree into every
process that imports ``crew_chat`` — including the Slack gateway, which imports
it at module scope. This module depends on config, cwd validation and agent
discovery only, so neither caller pays for the other's surface.

    ``_validate_agent`` runs on the loop and therefore reads ONLY
    ``cached_project_agent_names()``; without this warm, a spawn that names a
    project agent is refused ("not found") until some unrelated session happens
    to warm that project's cache. Best-effort and never raises.

    A caller-supplied cwd MUST pass the same ``validate_cwd()`` gate ``spawn()``
    itself applies BEFORE any discovery read touches it — warming first would
    read ``<cwd>/.kiro`` from a path the allowlist rejects. That applies to a
    STORED cwd on retry as much as a fresh one: the allowlist can have changed
    since the original spawn (a removed root must not stay warm-able forever),
    so the check is against the CURRENT config on every call. On rejection the
    cwd is simply not warmed and ``spawn()`` refuses it with the real error.
    The pool cwd is Kiro Crew's own default project dir and needs no allowlist.
    Config load + ``validate_cwd`` (realpath/isdir) are blocking filesystem
    work, so the whole check runs on the discovery pool.
