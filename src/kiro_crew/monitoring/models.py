    #: ``quiet_ticks`` counts the ticks the probe judged QUIET; ``wakes`` counts
    #: the turns actually DELIVERED because it judged otherwise -- not every
    #: non-quiet tick, since a gate that could not decide is ``gate_fallbacks``
    #: below and a fire the slot refuses is charged to neither. A quiet verdict
    #: is not the same as a free tick: the streak floor below deliberately
    #: delivers on one of them, so ``quiet_ticks`` minus ``floor_ticks`` is the
    #: count that cost no model turn. Reading ``quiet_ticks`` alone as "cost no
    #: turn" overstates the saving by exactly the floor.

    #: claiming the loop fired: a busy slot can still refuse that turn, and whether
    #: it landed is ``cycle_count``'s business. What this measures is GATE FAILURE,
    #: and a gate that could not decide has failed whether or not the slot happened
    #: to accept the turn. Counted apart from ``wakes`` so the metering cannot
    #: flatter itself: a gate that is permanently broken would otherwise read as
    #: a busy, well-used watch.

    #: findings, fixes some, and needs another turn to finish. The probe cannot
    #: see any of that: it watches the SUBJECT, so an agent that was woken and
    #: has not yet pushed produces no observable change, and a pure gate would
    #: report "nothing happened" and starve the work it just started. Firing once
    #: more after every wake costs one turn per wake and removes that stall
    #: entirely, which is the right trade against a watch that goes quiet holding
    #: half-finished work.

    #: has not replied, keep a branch rebased on a moving base -- produces no
    #: observable change and would never be delivered again. Inference cannot
    #: tell that intent from the wording, and guessing it is worse than bounding
    #: it: after enough consecutive quiet ticks the loop is delivered anyway.
    quiet_streak: int = 0

    #:
    #: The kernel commits its dedupe state BEFORE raising a wake, which is right

    #: awaits the verdict, the two come apart: cancel the await (a gateway
    #: shutdown lands mid-poll) and the observation is recorded as reported while
    #: no turn was ever dispatched, so the next run reads the same state as
    #: unchanged and the real signal is lost until the streak floor.
    #:
    #: Finding this flag still set on the next tick therefore means "a poll was
    #: interrupted and its result may already have been consumed on disk" -- so
    #: that tick fires instead of trusting a quiet verdict. Being wrong costs one
    #: turn; being silent costs the signal.

    #: loop has not been delivered yet. The VALUE is the outcome to record once it

    #: so the classification survives the wait without a second field and without
    #: writing ``outcome`` early.
