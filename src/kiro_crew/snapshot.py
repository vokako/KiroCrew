    declares it. In replace mode that is destructive rather than merely incomplete: the memory
    trees are cleared unconditionally (a tree the archive lacks must not be kept) and nothing
    replaces the one that was dropped.

    This is the ONLY layer where the two cases are distinguishable. Measured: at the mutation
    phase a rejected link and an archive that never carried the tree are byte for byte the same
    state -- the staged tree is simply absent -- so the prescribed check there ("clear only when
    the source is a directory") cannot tell them apart, and it would revert the unconditional
    clear that a documented defect required. Extraction, by contrast, knows.

    rejection anywhere OUTSIDE a tree that replace clears -- and that limit is the point.

    otherwise sound bundle is dropped and the restore SUCCEEDS (`assert ret == 0`). Refusing on
    any rejection at all was the prescribed shape and breaks three of those tests. What makes the

    """Copy the live SQLite database *src* to *dst* through the backup API, read-only.

    THE one place this module reads a live database on the creation path. Both staging
    paths -- the fixed core-file list and the tree re-stage pass -- call it, because a
    second, structurally identical copy of the hardening below is how one of the two
    drifts back.

    Four properties, each closing a failure that reported success:

    **The chain is verified through descriptors, not by name.** Every component from
    *root* down is opened relative to the previous one with ``O_NOFOLLOW``, so a directory
    that is a link -- or one swapped for a link while this runs -- fails its own open
    instead of redirecting the read. ``src.resolve()`` and a late ``realpath()`` are both
    a SECOND by-name walk and were both wrong here: they can land on a database this
    function never inspected, whose rows then ride in the bundle under an innocuous name.

    **The URI is percent-escaped.** ``as_uri()``, not interpolation: a POSIX filename
    containing ``?`` or ``#`` was otherwise parsed as the start of the URI's query or
    fragment, truncating the path so the copy opened a DIFFERENT database and stored it
    under the requested name. Built once and shared by the probe and the copy, because two
    spellings of one URI is how they diverge.

    **The connection is ``mode=ro``.** Staging only ever needs to read, and a read-write
    open is not merely more authority than required -- it MUTATES the live database.
    Measured on a fixture with a ``-wal`` left unreplayed by a killed writer: the
    read-write open recovered the log into the main file (8192 -> 16384 bytes, different
    hash) and unlinked the 836 KB ``-wal``; ``mode=ro`` left both byte-identical and
    captured exactly the same rows. So a backup command was rewriting the data it was
    asked to read, and in the window before SQLite's own open a swapped-in database was
    handed a writable handle. ``mode=ro`` refuses the write outright.

    **"Not a database" is told apart from "cannot read this database".** They are
    distinguished by probing readability separately from copying, not by matching the
    error, because ``sqlite_errorname`` is 3.11+ while this package supports 3.10 and
    message text changes with any SQLite release. The broad form was wrong in the
    dangerous direction: "database is locked" is also a ``DatabaseError``, so an exclusive
    writer made the probe report "not a database" and a raw byte copy shipped as if it
    were consistent.

    What this does NOT close, stated rather than implied: SQLite's API takes a PATH and
    cannot be pointed at a held descriptor -- probed, it refuses ``/proc/self/fd/N`` and
    ``/dev/fd/N`` alike -- so SQLite re-resolves the final name itself, and a same-uid
    swap in the window between the check above and that open is not detectable here. A
    post-hoc identity re-check does not close it either, since swapping back defeats the
    check. Closing it needs a descriptor-taking VFS, which is a different change.

    The WAL question the issue this came from also raises is NOT handled by checkpointing
    and copying bytes, and deliberately so: the backup API already reads a consistent
    snapshot that INCLUDES rows living only in the ``-wal``. Measured against a
    cross-process writer with ``wal_autocheckpoint=0`` and a 1.5 MB log, the copy
    contained all 421 rows -- 371 of them WAL-resident -- and passed ``integrity_check``.
    A check-then-copy-bytes design has the race; this one has no check to race.

    ``PRAGMA schema_version`` above only proves the file parses, which is a much weaker
    claim than restore's, and the two unsoundnesses it misses need checking at OPPOSITE
    ends. Both were measured rather than reasoned about.

    **Page corruption -- checked on the STAGED COPY.** With a database's interior pages
    overwritten and the header left intact, ``schema_version`` answered normally,
    ``backup()`` succeeded and faithfully staged all 192512 bytes, and ``integrity_check``
    reported "database disk image is malformed" on the source AND the copy. So the archive
    reported success and restore was guaranteed to refuse it; ``--keep N`` then counts it as
    the newest backup and prunes a real one, so the operator loses their last restorable
    copy at the one moment they reach for it. The copy is the right end to check: it is what
    goes in the archive and what restore validates, checking it keeps this path read-only
    with respect to live data, and it also catches a copy damaged in transit. Source
    corruption still surfaces, because ``backup()`` reproduces it.

    **A zero-byte source -- checked on the SOURCE, and ONLY visible there.** SQLite opens a
    zero-byte file as a valid EMPTY database, so ``integrity_check`` answers ``ok``. Worse,
    ``backup()`` does not preserve the emptiness: measured, a 0-byte source produced a
    4096-byte staged copy that ``integrity_check`` called ``ok``. Restore's own zero-byte
    guard reads the size of the ARCHIVED file, so it sees 4096 and accepts -- meaning that
    for this path restore does NOT refuse the archive, it RESTORES it and installs an empty
    database over live data while reporting success. That is why the check cannot be
    deferred to the copy or to restore: the "captured nothing" condition exists only at the
    source, which is the same reason restore reads size before opening.

    The cost is not a reason to hesitate: ``integrity_check`` measured 1285 MB/s against
    415 MB/s for the ``backup()`` and 227 MB/s for the gzip this command already performs
    over the same bytes unconditionally, so it adds about a tenth of work already paid.

    Raises ``DatabaseCopyFailed`` rather than restore's ``SourceComponentUnsound``: the try
    around ``_build_snapshot`` handles ``PinnedPathRefusal``, ``UnsafeComponentRoot`` and
    ``DatabaseCopyFailed``, so the restore-side type would leave here as a traceback --
    the same escape the chain check avoids.

    The plain tree copy already placed a byte copy there; this replaces it with a
    consistent one. Done as a second pass rather than by filtering the tree walk, so
    the copy logic stays in one place and a database newly appearing in a tree is
    covered without anyone remembering to register it.

    A file whose suffix says database but which SQLite cannot open is left as the byte
    copy already made -- UNLESS its bundle-relative path is in ``PRODUCT_TREE_DATABASES``,
    in which case the snapshot fails. That set's own contract is that everything in it is
    "validated as strictly as ``memory.db``", and the restore side already enforces exactly
    that (``_refuse_unless_sound(..., strict=rel in PRODUCT_TREE_DATABASES)``). Staging a
    corrupt ``workspace/knowledge/knowledge.db`` as bytes and reporting success therefore
    produces an archive that restore is guaranteed to refuse, which is worse than failing:
    ``--keep N`` counts the new archive as the newest backup and prunes a real one, so the
    operator loses their last restorable copy to a snapshot that "succeeded".

    *bundle_root* is what makes that key comparable. ``PRODUCT_TREE_DATABASES`` is spelled
    relative to a bundle root, while this pass walks one tree, so a tree-relative path would
    never match any entry and the strictness would be silently vacuous.

    A non-database that happens to be named ``.db`` and is NOT one of ours is still the
    operator's file and must ride the bundle: refusing a whole snapshot over a stray
    ``Thumbs.db`` would be an outage rather than a safeguard.

    A database the tree copy did NOT stage is left alone. This pass exists to REPLACE a
    byte copy with a consistent one, so a destination that does not already hold that byte
    copy means the walk deliberately declined the source -- a hardlink alias, a symlink, a
    non-regular entry -- and recreating it here from the source inode would reinstate
    exactly what the walk refused. Reproduced before this guard existed: a `.db` hardlinked
    to a database outside the component tree was skipped as `not_regular` and then rebuilt
    by this pass, putting the external database's rows in the bundle. Checking the PARENT
    directory is not enough, because the parent exists for every sibling that copied fine.

    *on_skip* is how a degradation reaches ``MANIFEST.json``. A source that cannot be
    verified link-free leaves the tree walk's byte copy in place, which is the right call
    -- deleting it is data loss -- but the bundle then holds a database that was never
    copied consistently, and that belongs on the record rather than only in the console
    scrollback of whoever ran the command.

    THE chokepoint for component tree roots. Three separate sites touch them — the
    staging walk, the replace pass and the merge pass — and each was found to
    dereference a link independently, so the check lives here once.

    Two INDEPENDENT properties are required, and neither implies the other:

    **Containment** — the fully resolved path is a strict descendant of the resolved
    home. This answers "can a read or write through this root land outside the
    directory we are allowed to touch". Checking whether the node itself is a link
    does not answer it: a link nested under the root, or an ancestor of it, escapes
    while every individual node looks ordinary. ``Path.resolve()`` follows every link
    in the path, so the comparison covers roots, ancestors, descendants and Windows
    junctions at once. Equality with the home is refused, not allowed: a link like
    ``workspace/memory -> ..`` resolves to the home itself, which would make the
    "component tree" the whole home and sweep ``.env`` and ``sel_hmac.key`` into an
    archive meant to carry memory. No declared component tree is ever the home.

    **Identity** — no path segment from the home down to the root is a link. This
    answers a different question: "is this the tree the component declared". A link
    that redirects to another subtree INSIDE the home satisfies containment perfectly
    — ``workspace/memory -> ../apps`` resolves to a strict descendant — while
    silently changing WHICH data is archived. Because these bundles are uploaded, a
    redirect is an exfiltration primitive, not a mix-up: the archive would carry
    whatever the link points at under the name of the component that was asked for.

def _notification_key(record: bytes, path: Path) -> tuple[Any, ...] | None:
    """The dedupe key for one raw notification record, or ``None`` if it has none.

    Well-defined and hashable for EVERY record shape. A naive
    ``json.loads(line).get("ts") or line.strip()`` is not: a non-object record
    raises ``AttributeError`` off ``.get``, and a list or dict ``ts`` raises
    ``TypeError`` on set insert, and both escape as an aborted restore.

    A ``ts`` is used whenever it is truthy AND hashable, which is every JSON
    scalar. Restricting it to ``str`` is WORSE than keying a numeric ``ts`` on
    the number: two rows carrying the same numeric ``ts`` with different bytes
    -- one normalised, one not -- have to deduplicate, and keying them on their
    raw form instead persists a duplicate. Only an unhashable ``ts``, which
    cannot be a set member at all, falls through to the raw form.

    The ``ts`` goes into the key under a KIND TAG that is deliberately coarser
    than its Python type, because two different equalities are in play at once
    and a naive tag gets one of them wrong:

    * ``True == 1`` and ``hash(True) == hash(1)``, so an untagged key makes a row
      with ``ts: true`` and a row with ``ts: 1`` one set member and DELETES the
      second as a duplicate.
    * ``1 == 1.0`` and they hash equal too, so tagging with
      ``type(ts).__name__`` splits a row written as an integer here and a float
      there -- an ordinary serializer artefact -- into two records and PERSISTS a
      duplicate.

    An earlier revision hit each of those in turn. One tag covers both: integers
    and floats share ``"num"`` so they still deduplicate exactly as the
    predecessor's bare-value key did, while ``bool`` is its own tag. ``bool`` is
    tested first because it is a SUBCLASS of ``int``, so an ``isinstance(ts,
    int)`` check would swallow it.

    A record with no usable ``ts`` falls back to its RAW BYTES, and a record that
    does not PARSE gets no key at all. The split is the fix. The predecessor fell
    back to ``line.strip()`` for both, and stripping is what deleted bytes: it
    makes two DISTINCT byte sequences share a key. Unstripped bytes cannot --
    byte-equal records ARE the same record, so collapsing them loses nothing.
    Withholding a key from an unparseable record covers the remaining case,
    because the fragments a split record produces are exactly the unparseable
    ones.

    That is reachable, not theoretical, and it is why the two cases are separated.
    A crash mid-append leaves a truncated row in the live file -- say ``b'{"a":
    "x'``. A source record holding a bare carriage return is split at it, because
    this reader's boundaries are the universal-newline set, yielding ``b'{"a":
    "x\r'``. Those two are NOT byte-equal, but they STRIP to the same thing, so
    the predecessor skipped the fragment as a duplicate, appended only the tail,
    and left the live file with a line parsing as neither while the source's bytes
    were gone. Measured on real bytes, before and after: stripping loses them,
    raw bytes do not. The fragment is also unparseable, so it takes the ``None``
    path and is doubly protected.

    So a ``ts``-less row that parses IS deduplicated, on bytes -- which keeps the
    predecessor's idempotence for a re-run without keeping the deletion. Only an
    unparseable record is appended unconditionally.
    Duplicating a row is recoverable; deleting one is not. ``_merge_notifications``
    validates the whole source before appending anything so that a FAILED merge
    does not leave a prefix for a retry to duplicate.

    The kind tag also keeps the two families apart: ``json.loads`` can only
    produce ``dict``, ``list``, ``str``, ``int``, ``float``, ``bool`` or ``None``,
    so ``type(ts).__name__`` is never ``"raw"`` and a byte key can never collide
    with a ``ts`` key.

    Raises :class:`UndecodableRecord` for a record that is not valid UTF-8,
    which is how the encoding property is enforced: this decode VALIDATES and
    the result is used only for the key, while what gets appended is always the
    original bytes. Validating by decoding and then writing the decoded form
    back is what makes the copy non-byte-exact in the first place.

def _merge_notifications(src_path: Path, dst_path: Path) -> None:
    """Append the snapshot's notification records to the live file, byte for byte.

    This is the only merge that COPIES records rather than consuming them, so
    reading faithfully is not the whole contract -- the bytes must also be valid
    for the destination. Both handles are BINARY and framing comes from
    :func:`strict_raw_records`, because the text-mode predecessor was a locale
    decode followed by a locale encode and neither half was byte-exact:

    * Universal-newline translation on read, ``os.linesep`` on write. A record
      terminated ``\\r\\n`` was appended as ``\\n`` -- a byte silently dropped --
      and a bare ``\\r`` INSIDE a record split it in two, so both halves failed
      ``json.loads``, the ``except`` swallowed both, and the record was lost
      while the function printed success. Both fire on a pure UTF-8 host with
      fully valid UTF-8 input, so an explicit ``encoding=`` does not address
      them; ``newline=`` is a separate axis and binary mode closes both at once.
    * The locale codec decided whether an invalid-UTF-8 record aborted the
      restore or was delivered into the live file. ``for line in f`` decodes
      OUTSIDE the ``try``, so ``UnicodeDecodeError`` -- a ``ValueError`` --
      escaped the ``except (ValueError, TypeError)`` because the iterator raised
      it, not ``json.loads``. On a UTF-8 host that aborted the restore with a
      traceback; under a single-byte locale the decode succeeded, the encode put
      the same bytes back, and the live file stopped being valid UTF-8 -- after
      which its loader returns NO rows for the whole file and the next rewrite
      persists that empty view.

    The posture is ABORT, never skip, because the output feeds a durable write
    and a skipped record is a deleted one. Abort means RAISE, not warn: this
    function's callers report an outcome to somebody. ``apply_import_zip``
    appends ``notifications (merged)`` to its summary and the dashboard handler
    answers ``ok: True`` with a SEL ``outcome="ok"``, and a printed warning is
    invisible to both -- so warn-and-return would tell an API caller the import
    succeeded while records were left behind. The print stays so a CLI operator
    reads the reason before the traceback. This is why it differs from
    ``_merge_crons``, which warns and returns: a refused cron merge writes
    nothing and skips one component, while this one may already have appended a
    prefix, and the caller has to learn the write is incomplete.

    * A destination-scan failure is still a true no-op -- the destination is not
      even opened for append until that scan has completed.
    * The SOURCE is validated whole before the destination is opened for append,
      so a source-side refusal is also a no-op. Without that pass, a source whose
      Nth record is undecodable had already appended N-1 records when it aborted,
      and a retry re-appended every identity-less one of them, since a row with
      no ``ts`` cannot be deduplicated. The cost is reading the source twice.
    * A failure DURING the copy is therefore the residual case -- the source
      changed between the two passes -- and its prefix stays. Rolling it back
      would be a second unvalidated write to the live file.

    Every appended record ends with a terminator, and an unterminated final
    record already in the destination gains one before anything is appended
    after it. Without that, two records glued into one line that parses as
    neither.

def _serialise_with_notification_writes(work: Callable[[], None]) -> None:
    """Run *work* in FIFO order with the dashboard's own notification writes.

    ``_install_notifications`` writes the live ``notifications.jsonl`` while the
    gateway may be writing it too, and ``O_APPEND`` alone is not enough. It stops a
    concurrent row being OVERWRITTEN, and then orders it BEFORE the archive's rows:
    the dashboard's append goes to end-of-file immediately while the copy's writes are
    still buffered, so the live row lands first and the archive's follow it. The
    reader's cap is POSITIONAL -- ``_load_notifications`` keeps the last
    ``_MAX_PERSISTED_NOTIFICATIONS`` rows, not the newest by timestamp -- so importing
    a full 200-record history pushes the live row out of the window. Measured: a note
    delivered mid-copy landed at line 0 of 201 and the reader returned 200 rows
    without it. The loss is silent: the operator was told the notification was
    delivered, and after the next reload it is gone.

    Notification persistence runs on ONE worker in submission order
    (``_notification_io_executor``), so running the copy on that same worker is what
    makes the two ordered rather than concurrent. A queued append then runs strictly
    after the copy and lands at the end of the file, where the cap keeps it.

    The trap in deciding whether to serialise is treating the absence of an OBSERVABLE
    writer as the absence of a writer. "No pool" does not mean "no writer"; the writer is
    what makes the pool. A fresh gateway has persisted nothing, so its pool is ``None``,
    and a copy running inline on that basis races a delivery arriving at that moment: the
    delivery CREATES the executor and appends through it, concurrently, putting the live
    row back at line 0 of 201 and outside the reader's window. A broad
    ``except Exception`` on the import one line above is the same error in another form:
    it turns "I could not check" into "there is nothing to check", losing the ordering
    silently inside a live gateway.

    So this ACQUIRES rather than asks. ``_notification_io_executor()`` creates the
    worker if there is none and returns the existing one if there is. That removes the
    "is there a pool" question outright and narrows the import case to ``ImportError``.

    TWO inline cases remain, and neither reads an absence of OBSERVATION as an absence
    of a writer:

    1. Already ON the worker. Then we ARE the ordering point, and submitting would wait
       for a queue only this call can drain -- a deadlock rather than a race.
    2. The dashboard module does not import. A missing MODULE is categorically different
       from a missing pool: the sink lives in that module, so if it is not importable
       there is no writer that could exist, rather than none currently visible. That is
       the CLI restore. Narrowed to ``ImportError`` precisely so it cannot absorb
       anything else -- a module that fails to import for any OTHER reason is a real
       failure and must surface rather than quietly degrade the guarantee.

    Acquiring costs the CLI path one idle worker thread. That is a short-lived process
    and the thread exits at interpreter shutdown; a silent ordering hole is permanent, so
    the trade is not close.

    The executor is released as soon as *work* returns OR raises: ``result()``
    re-raises rather than swallowing, so the failure path needs no separate release
    and cannot leave notification writes blocked.

    Relying on that executor for ordering means its own CREATION has to be ordered too.
    An unlocked check-then-set would let two threads each observe ``None``, each build a
    pool, and never be serialised against one another -- which would void this guarantee
    rather than weaken it. ``dashboard/state.py`` takes a lock around the lazy init, so
    acquiring the executor is itself race-free.

    """Install the snapshot's notification records, ordered against the live writer.

    Refuses outright where ``O_NOFOLLOW`` does not exist -- see below. The refusal is
    made HERE, before the executor is acquired and before anything is opened, because
    it is a question about the platform rather than about this source.

    The whole body runs on the dashboard's notification worker when one exists, so a
    row the gateway delivers during the restore cannot be ordered ahead of the
    archive's and dropped by the reader's positional cap. See
    :func:`_serialise_with_notification_writes` for why ``O_APPEND`` alone was not
    enough, and note the cost: a restore briefly blocks notification writes. A
    restore is rare and user-initiated; a lost notification is silent and permanent.

    WHY A MISSING ``O_NOFOLLOW`` REFUSES INSTEAD OF FALLING BACK. The predecessor
    checked ``pinned_fs.is_reparse_point(src_path)`` by NAME and then opened the same
    NAME. Against an adversary that is not a floor, it is a check-to-open window: the
    threat model this function is written for -- stated in ``_install_notifications``
    and demonstrated by the revision review blocked -- is a concurrent agent replacing
    the extracted file, and such an agent chooses the timing. The descriptor check does
    not save it either: ``fstat`` asserts ``S_ISREG``, and a reparse point resolving to
    a regular ``.env`` passes ``S_ISREG``. So on a platform with no ``O_NOFOLLOW`` there
    is no sequence of by-name checks that makes this safe, and the honest move is to not
    do it.

    The alternative -- a ctypes ``CreateFileW`` with ``FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT`` --
    is declined, and not by me: ``eval/bench/safepath.py`` records that it "is no longer
    worth considering here: it would buy the same property exclusive creation already
    has, at the price of security code that cannot be exercised on the machine this
    harness is developed on", and ``skill_trust.py`` records that Python "does not expose
    an equivalent handle-relative, no-reparse walk on Windows". Both decline the capable
    route, which means this repo has already chosen less capability on that platform over
    a hand-rolled walk. Refusing extends those two decisions; falling back contradicts
    them.

    The cost is not symmetric, which is what makes the trade easy. Refusing loses
    notification HISTORY on one platform for one operation -- the records remain in the
    snapshot and nothing is destroyed. Falling back can put attacker-chosen bytes, a
    credentials file among them, into a location the agent then reads. And this PR exists
    because snapshot restore installed unvalidated bytes: a remaining path that installs
    attacker-chosen bytes is the same defect, closed everywhere except where it is
    hardest.

    The refusal is LOUD and the callers report the skip. A silent skip would be the same
    class of bug as the one being fixed, so the message names the platform, the missing
    primitive, and what was not imported.

def _install_notifications(src_path: Path, dst_path: Path) -> None:
    """Install the snapshot's notification records where the live file does not exist yet.

    The sibling of ``_merge_notifications``, and the reason it exists separately
    is that the two branches of one ``if`` had different postures: the merge
    validates every source record's encoding and ABORTS on one it cannot deliver
    intact, while this branch was ``shutil.copy2`` and validated nothing. A
    byte-exact copy is correct as a copy and that is exactly the problem -- it
    faithfully installs bytes the destination's own reader refuses.
    ``_load_notifications`` decodes the WHOLE file inside one ``try`` that
    returns ``[]``, so one invalid byte costs every row, and the next
    ``_rewrite_notifications`` -- any delete, ack or clear -- persists that empty
    view. Unlike the merge this fired on every locale, because nothing decoded on
    the way in, and it fired on a fresh install or a first restore, where the
    operator has the least reason to suspect anything.

    So the posture matches the merge: ABORT, never accept, never skip. That is not
    a new product decision, it is the decision the merge branch already carries --
    a snapshot with an undecodable record aborted the restore when a live file
    existed and was installed silently when one did not.

    It is a SEPARATE function rather than a call into the merge with an empty
    destination, and both halves of that were measured, not assumed:

    * ``_merge_notifications`` opens the destination for READ first, so a missing
      one raises ``FileNotFoundError`` out of the arm that guarantees a
      destination-scan failure is a true no-op. Teaching that arm to tell
      "missing, fine" from "unreadable, abort" reopens the fail-closed posture
      that arm exists for.
    * The merge DEDUPLICATES against what it has already written, which a copy
      must not: run four source records -- two sharing a ``ts``, two byte-identical
      without one -- through a merge into an empty destination and two land. There
      is nothing here to deduplicate against, so keying source records against
      each other converts a faithful copy into a lossy one.

    Every path here is resolved to a descriptor EXACTLY ONCE and all later work goes
    through that descriptor. That invariant closes a whole class rather than single
    instances of it: the defect is an operation resolving a name more than once where
    another process can change what the name means, and a fix that only re-checks moves
    which name is vulnerable instead of removing the second resolution. The source is
    opened once
    ``O_RDONLY|O_NOFOLLOW|O_NONBLOCK|O_BINARY`` and read once, never seeked; the
    destination is created once
    ``O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_NOFOLLOW|O_BINARY``. The
    remaining uses of either path -- ``_safe_name`` in the messages, and the ``path``
    argument to ``strict_raw_records`` and ``_notification_key`` -- resolve nothing:
    both callees only interpolate it into an error string.

    That invariant is descriptor-bound on POSIX and CANNOT be on Windows, which has no
    ``O_NOFOLLOW``: there the flag is 0. The predecessor put a by-name reparse-point
    check in front of the open and treated it as a floor; it is not one, because a
    by-name check followed by a by-name open is a window the concurrent agent in this
    threat model chooses the timing of, and ``fstat``'s ``S_ISREG`` does not close it --
    a reparse point resolving to a regular ``.env`` passes it. So this function is not
    reached at all on such a platform: :func:`_copy_notifications` refuses the copy
    before acquiring the executor. Naming the split rather than implying it, because
    the two genuinely differ in what they can promise -- POSIX refuses a link inside
    the open syscall, and a platform without the flag does not attempt the copy.

    The caller reaches this branch on ``sn.is_file()`` and ``not dn.is_file()``, which
    are by-name and therefore advisory. They are not trusted: each is confirmed or
    refuted by the single authoritative resolution here. A destination that filled
    after the check fails ``O_EXCL``, and a source that became a link or a FIFO fails
    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` or the ``S_ISREG`` check on the descriptor. What is NOT closed here
    is the ancestor chain -- both opens name a directory rather than a pinned
    descriptor -- and that is deliberate: every core-file copy in this function
    reaches its path the same way, so pinning one of ten sites would be the point
    patch review already named. It is an axis for its own change.

    ONE read of the source, and the ordering is the whole design:

    1. The source is read ONCE, whole, under a byte cap, and the file is never
       touched again. Everything after that reads the bytes in hand.
    2. Those bytes are validated in full. A refusal here happens with the
       destination never created, so there is nothing to roll back -- which matters
       because there is no safe rollback: creating the live file and unlinking it on
       refusal loses data -- ``apply_import_zip`` runs inside the live gateway, so the
       dashboard's notification sink can append to that file first and the unlink
       takes the operator's notification with it.
    3. The destination is then created
       ``O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_NOFOLLOW|O_BINARY`` and the validated
       bytes are written. ``O_EXCL`` decides inside one syscall, so a name that
       filled after the caller's ``is_file()`` check is refused rather than written
       through -- a dangling symlink at that name included, which ``is_file()``
       reports as absent and ``copy2`` followed, writing the archive's bytes outside
       the data home.

    Reading once is not an optimisation, it is what makes a whole class of defect
    UNREPRESENTABLE rather than detected. Reading the file twice -- validate, then
    install -- leaves a window with many different ways for the source to change
    inside it: swapped for a symlink to a credential, reopened by name, truncated so
    the second pass meets a clean EOF and reports success having installed fewer
    records than it validated. Closing one variant only exposes the next, because a
    check can only catch the case someone thought of. With the bytes held in memory
    there is no name
    left to resolve and no handle left open, so there is nothing for another process
    to swap, truncate or extend. The two loops below are two passes over the same
    immutable bytes, which is safe for exactly the reason two passes over the FILE
    were not.

    That trade needs a number, not a preference, and the number is the destination's
    own bound: see ``_NOTIFICATION_SOURCE_CAP``. Peak held is about twice the SOURCE
    size rather than twice the cap -- measured at 15.9 MiB for the 8.3 MB
    product-bounded worst case and 1.0 MiB for a realistic 207-record file, against
    the 128 MiB this same file already accepts for a SINGLE record. A source over the
    cap is refused with its size named -- never truncated, never partially imported,
    because a silently dropped tail is the defect being removed wearing a hat.

    No temporary file, deliberately: a temp file in the data home is published through
    a NAME, and a same-user process that can list that directory can swap what the name
    holds between the write and the
    publish -- which links bytes this function never validated into place as
    ``notifications.jsonl``. The mitigations for that are inode verification on both
    ends plus a non-hardlink fallback (``pinned_fs.put_back_no_clobber`` is the
    repo's audited version, and its own docstring notes the landed check narrows the
    window rather than closing it). Writing straight to an ``O_EXCL`` destination
    needs none of it: there is no intermediate name to swap.

    What this does NOT close: everything on the DESTINATION side. ``O_EXCL`` refuses a
    name that filled, ``O_APPEND`` keeps a concurrent notification from being
    overwritten, and both remain necessary -- the live file has other writers and
    reading the source once says nothing about them. Only the read window is gone.

    Records are written verbatim -- what is validated is the source's bytes, never a
    decoded form of them -- with a single repair: an unterminated final record gains
    a terminator. That is not cosmetic once the write is record-wise.
    ``_persist_notification`` appends ``json.dumps(note) + "\\n"``, so the first
    notification after the restore would otherwise glue onto an unterminated last
    line and produce one line that parses as neither row. It is the same repair the
    merge makes through ``dst_unterminated``.

    preference. Putting the incoming file where the live one was and only then checking it
    can report that the home is now sitting on a corrupt database, which is the outcome the
    check exists to prevent. A bundle arriving over the network from object storage is
    untrusted input no matter whose bucket held it, so it is validated at the point where
    refusing is still free.

    **The condition is "does this restore read or install the file", not "is this replace
    mode".** Replace installs everything it carries, so *mc_for_merge* is ``None`` and
    every declared entry is checked. Merge is per-file, because merge is not one behaviour:
    it installs some files, parses others in place, and leaves the rest alone — see
    `_merge_reads` for the three cases and why a single destination-existence test was the
    wrong proxy for all of them.

    Every incoming database for the SELECTED components is checked, not just the largest
    or the first.

    Unreadable counts as unsound. Tolerating a file named `.db` that SQLite cannot open
    is right when *creating* a snapshot (the operator's home is the source of truth and
    the file is copied verbatim), and wrong when consuming one: there the file is about
    to BECOME the operator's memory.

    A database is not the only thing a restore can install broken. The consumers of these
    files treat an unreadable one as an EMPTY one — `crons.json`'s loader falls back to
    "no jobs" on both a parse error and a well-formed array — so installing a corrupt file
    silently discards the operator's content while the restore reports success. Silent
    emptiness is the worst failure available here: nothing raises, so nothing is retried.

    *installed* is what separates the two hazards, because only one of them is silent.
    Replace INSTALLS this file, so an unparseable one reaches the consumer and reads as
    empty — refusing is the only way the operator hears about it. Merge USUALLY does not
    install it: when a live copy exists, the per-component merger reads the bundle's copy,
    reports a file it cannot parse, and returns without writing live state, so the content
    is neither lost nor lost quietly. Refusing there would turn one unreadable component
    into a failed restore of every other one, which is the opposite of what an off-host
    backup is for.

    "Usually" is load-bearing, not "never". Merge's per-component branch merges only
    `if dst.is_file()`; its sibling `else` copies the bundle's file in VERBATIM. So an
    absent destination -- the fresh-machine case, which is the scenario a backup exists
    for -- does install, and is the one path that could skip this check. The caller
    therefore decides *installed* from "will this reach a consumer", not from "is this a
    replace". Reproduced before the fix: a well-formed JSON array, no live `crons.json`,
    merge copied it verbatim and reported success, and the cron loader then read zero jobs.

    Only structure is checked, not schema. Parsing proves the file survived transport and
    is the shape its consumer branches on; asserting field-level schema here would
    duplicate each consumer's own validation and refuse bundles those consumers accept.

    The shape checks below are gated on *installed* too, matching the parse branch,
    because the merger itself now guards the merge path: `_merge_crons` runs
    `_usable_cron_shape` over BOTH sides and returns without writing when either is

    The recovery half of replace-mode atomicity. Undoing the whole saved set returns the
    data home to one coherent generation regardless of how far the pass got. Recovering
    only the item that failed is what leaves memory half-old and half-new.

    **Granularity is the invariant, and it is exactly *targets*.** Every entry is a
    declared relative path, and recovery touches nothing else. Walking the rollback
    DIRECTORY instead looks equivalent and is not: memory's trees are nested
    (``workspace/memory``), so ``backup`` contains a partial ``workspace/`` holding only
    those subtrees. Treating that directory as one unit clears the live ``workspace``
    whole and puts the partial copy back — deleting unrelated workspace data the restore
    never touched. Restoring `workspace/memory` restores `workspace/memory`.

    Three cases per target, and the third is why *installed* exists:

    * **Saved** — put it back, clearing only that path.
    * **Not saved, and this run installed it** — it did not exist before, so the copy the
      restore created is REMOVED. That is what "no pre-restore state" restores to.
    * **Not saved, and this run never reached it** — LEFT ALONE. Absence of a saved copy
      does not mean absence of prior state: a file is saved by MOVING it aside at the
      moment of its own mutation, so a failure partway through the phase leaves every
      later target untouched and unsaved. Removing those deletes the operator's own data
      that this restore never so much as opened, which is the opposite of recovery.

    Best-effort per target, and it says so per target: a recovery that aborts on its
    first problem strands the rest, and by this point the operator's own data is what is
    at stake. Whatever cannot be undone is named, and this function never deletes the
