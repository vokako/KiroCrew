# ── Canonical "[OPTIONS: a | b | c]" trailer parsers ────────────────────────
# The agent emits a trailing ``[OPTIONS: choice1 | choice2 | ...]`` marker that
# every surface renders as tappable choices. Two variants exist because the
# surfaces scan differently, but their GRAMMAR must stay identical — so both are
# defined here ONCE and imported everywhere: a hand-mirrored copy risks a
# one-character slip that flips the flag semantics or reintroduces the ReDoS
# class below on a single surface.
#
# Body: a TEMPERED greedy repetition that allows every bracket EXCEPT a ``[``
# that begins a fresh ``[OPTIONS:``. This matters for ReDoS (py/polynomial-redos):
# a plain greedy ``.*`` body can itself consume a ``[`` that also starts the outer
# ``[OPTIONS:`` literal, so over untrusted text with many ``[OPTIONS:`` prefixes
# ``search()``/``findall()`` re-explore the body from each position — polynomial
# backtracking. The tempered body is unambiguous (linear) while still capturing a
# literal ``]`` and any other inner ``[`` inside an option ("Fix [x] logging",
# "a[1]"). This parser runs over untrusted LLM/relayed text before Slack, the
# dashboard, Discord, Telegram, and WeCom render it.
#
# LINE (``re.MULTILINE``, ``$`` anchor) — for Slack/dashboard, where the marker
# ends a LINE (not necessarily the whole message). The negated class EXCLUDES
# ``\n`` (``[^[\n]``): in Python ``re`` a negated class matches ``\n`` regardless
# of DOTALL, so ``[^[]`` here would silently widen the single-line body to span
# lines (deleting/splitting a multi-line span the old single-line ``.*`` never
# matched). Trailing class is ``[ \t]`` (NOT ``\s``, which under MULTILINE would
# also match ``\n``).
#
# OPTIONAL MARKDOWN-LINK CLOSE ``(?:\(...\))?`` after the ``]``: models sometimes
# append a stray ``(OPTIONS)`` (or any ``(...)``) right after the marker, e.g.
# ``[OPTIONS: A | B | C](OPTIONS)``. That does TWO bad things at once: the extra
# text after ``]`` breaks the end anchor so the marker leaks unparsed, AND
# ``[label](url)`` is valid Markdown so the dashboard renders the whole thing as a
# clickable link instead of buttons. Absorbing a single tightly-attached ``(...)``
# here (it stays OUTSIDE the captured label group, so choices are unaffected)
# makes the parser resilient to that tic. The ``(`` must follow the ``]`` with no
# gap, so genuine trailing prose (``] and then...``) or a spaced note (``] (note)``)
# still fails the anchor and is left intact — the deliberate "trailing note on the
# same line" behaviour is preserved. The inner class is ``[^\s()]`` (NOT ``[^)\n]``)
# so it shares NO character with the trailing ``[ \t]*`` — that keeps the added group
# unambiguous and avoids a polynomial-ReDoS (``py/polynomial-redos``) backtracking
# path over ``[OPTIONS:`` + a long whitespace run. The real tic (``(OPTIONS)``, a
# bare ``(url)``) contains no whitespace or nested parens, so nothing is lost.
#: Closing brackets accepted on a protocol marker. ASCII ``]`` is the only form
#: the prompt ever specifies, but a model intermittently substitutes a fullwidth
#: or CJK lookalike — U+3011 ``】`` is the observed one; U+FF3D ``］`` and U+3015
#: ``〕`` are the same class of slip. A single wrong codepoint otherwise breaks
#: the end anchor, so the whole marker leaks into the visible message as literal
#: text and the turn silently loses its follow-up pills. Label content is
#: unaffected either way, so accepting the lookalike costs nothing.
#:
#: ONE definition, shared by both regexes below. Deliberately NOT used by
#: :func:`split_trailing_protocol_suffix`'s unfinished-marker check, which stays
#: ASCII-only on purpose -- see the comment there. That asymmetry is the point:
#: completeness is decided by the trailer regex, not by whether some closer
#: character happens to appear in the tail.
#:
#: ReDoS profile is the same as a bare literal ``\]``. The class shares
#: no character with the trailing ``[ \t]*`` / ``\s*``, and the tempered body
#: already admitted ``]`` via ``[^[\n]``, so adding these three codepoints
#: introduces no new ambiguity.

#: Markdown WRAPPER characters tolerated around a complete marker line.
#: A model sometimes wraps the whole marker in inline code or emphasis --
#: ``\`[OPTIONS: A | B]\``` or ``**[OPTIONS: A | B]**``. The wrapper character
#: lands AFTER the closer, breaks the end anchor, and the marker leaks into the
#: visible message as literal text while the turn silently loses its pills --
#: the same class of model tic as the stray ``](OPTIONS)`` suffix the grammar
#: already absorbs. Scope is deliberately tight so real prose never matches:
#: a LEADING wrapper is accepted only at line start (after optional indent), so
#: emphasis belonging to preceding prose (``**Choose:** [OPTIONS: ...]``) is
#: never eaten, and a TRAILING wrapper only when the marker itself OPENED one:
#: the ``(?(lwrap)...)`` conditional arms only when the ``lwrap`` group
#: captured a nonempty line-leading run. This is the invariant that makes every
#: reviewed corruption shape unreachable at once (mid-line code span
#: ``\`Use [OPTIONS: A | B]\```, a streaming frame's stray run, a MULTILINE
#: emphasis closer ``**Choose one\n[OPTIONS: A | B]**``): a run at line start
#: can only OPEN emphasis under CommonMark flanking rules (preceded by a
#: newline, it is not right-flanking), while a run after the closer can only
#: CLOSE something -- and if the marker did not open it, it belongs to the
#: enclosing prose and must survive the strip. A bare or mid-line marker keeps
#: the pre-widening grammar exactly. Leading-only stays absorbed (nothing
#: follows the closer, so nothing can be stolen); trailing-only does not
#: match and renders literally, as it did before the widening. Runs are capped
#: at 3 (``***`` is the longest CommonMark emphasis run; 4+ is not a wrapper).
#:
#: ReDoS profile unchanged: the class shares no character with the trailing
#: ``[ \t]*`` / ``\s*`` or the indent class, and both wrapper positions are
#: anchored by the required ``[OPTIONS:`` literal, so no new ambiguity exists.

# CONTROL-TAG HTML COMMENTS — canonical grammar (single source of truth).
#
# Agent control tags ride in HTML comments, which the dashboard's markdown
# pipeline renders as nothing (rehype-raw emits comment nodes the react
# renderer skips). Three families exist in ``src/``:
#   * ``<!-- keep-visible -->``       — collapse-all exemption
#   * ``<!-- deliver:<route> -->``    — heartbeat routing
#   * ``<!-- plan_task_id:<id> -->``  — task-planner Apply-to-Tasks anchor
#
# ONE GRAMMAR, TAIL-ANCHORED + FENCE-GUARDED, case-insensitive, both
# recognizers (this regex and ``website/src/app-sdk/protocol/
# keepVisibleMarker.ts``): only standalone tag lines at the message tail are
# control tags, and a tail inside an UNTERMINATED fence is visible code (see
# ``_in_open_fence``). Message-tail producers: the prompt rule ("as its
# final line") and the task-planner appender (newline-prefixed). The
# heartbeat's ``deliver:`` tags are HEARTBEAT.md FILE-format suffixes on
# checklist lines, not message-tail emissions — echoed into a message body
# they are mid-body content, which the dashboard renders as nothing and this
# strip deliberately leaves alone. Position-independent stripping was tried
# and retired: rounds 5–8 each surfaced another quoted-code dialect it
# corrupted.
#
# Tag-line leading indent is ≤3 (CommonMark: 4+ spaces renders as an
# indented code block — visible content, never a control tag).
# ReDoS note: every quantifier is BOUNDED (whitespace ≤16, tag body ≤256 —
# generous for real emissions like ``<!-- deliver:dashboard -->``), so a
# failed match attempt does constant work and total matching stays linear
# even on adversarial repetition input (CodeQL py/polynomial-redos: an
# UNBOUNDED body with a failing ``-->`` suffix rescans per start position —
# quadratic). An unterminated ``<!--`` is NOT matched: swallowing to
# end-of-text on a missing ``-->`` silently deletes visible prose. A tag

# AWS named-profile name shape — the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH. Hand-copying the
# charset into separate compiled patterns reintroduced the missing-'+' defect
# twice, so every in-package
# validator derives from these; the two standalone artifact-deploy scripts
# (which cannot import the package) embed AWS_PROFILE_NAME_PATTERN verbatim
# under a byte-equality drift guard in test/test_aws_profile_charset.py.
#
# Semantics:
# * '+' admitted — IAM Identity Center derives "<account>+<permission-set>"
#   profile names.
# * The first char excludes '-' so a stored name is never option-shaped when it
#   later reaches a discrete ``--profile <value>`` argv element.
# * \Z anchor — '$' matches just before a trailing newline; \Z rejects it.
#   Call sites that match a raw (unstripped) value rely on this.
# * Length capped at 128 inside the pattern, matching the FieldSpec
#   ``max_len=128`` the deploy boundaries enforce.
#
# A site with a DELIBERATE semantic difference (e.g. aws_consent.py's wider
# legacy continuation charset) derives its character class from these
# fragments rather than re-spelling them. COMPOSE FROM AWS_PROFILE_FIRST_CHARS
# ONLY (it carries no literal '-', so extra chars may follow it safely, e.g.
# rf"[{AWS_PROFILE_FIRST_CHARS}@=-]"). AWS_PROFILE_CHARS ends with a literal
# '-' and is safe ONLY in terminal position — appending anything after it
# turns the trailing '-' into a RANGE (e.g. "+-@" spans 0x2B-0x40, silently
# admitting '/', ':' and ';'). test_aws_profile_charset.py pins this contract.

SLACK_NAMESPACE = "slack"

#: Session-key namespaces owned by a messaging channel, i.e. every prefix a
#: conversation started OUTSIDE the dashboard can carry. Slack keys are
#: ``slack:<thread_ts>``; every other transport uses
#: ``{channel}:{agent}:{chatType}:{user}[:genN]`` (see
#: ``messaging.link.build_dm_session_key``), plus the ``unified:`` bucket that
#: ``dm_scope="unified"`` collapses direct DMs into.
#:
#: Deliberately excludes the non-channel namespaces that also contain a colon
#: (``dashboard:``, ``cron:``, ``hook:``, ``subagent:``, ``channel:``) — those
#: are surfaced by their own owners, not by the channel-session reconciler.
#:
#: NOTE: ``autonudge._CHANNEL_KEY_PREFIXES`` is a SEPARATE hand-kept copy. It is
#: often described as narrower; as of this writing it is not -- both hold the same
#: 11 namespaces. It answers a different question (does this key SHAPE belong to a
#: channel rather than a dashboard slot), which is why it lists namespaces nothing
#: can currently be delivered to. Deriving it from here would be sound and is
#: deliberately left out of the change that homed this roster; until then, do not
#: assume the two have diverged, and do not assume they are kept in step either.
#:
#: HOMED HERE, not in ``messaging.link``, because the roster has readers on both
#: sides of an import cycle. ``messaging.link`` is itself stdlib-only, but
#: importing anything from it executes ``messaging/__init__.py`` first, which
#: pulls in ``driver`` -> ``acp`` -> ``hooks``; a reader that ``hooks`` is already
#: mid-import for (``hooks`` -> ``webhooks`` -> ``validation``) then fails with a
#: partially-initialized ``hooks``. This module imports only ``os`` and ``re``, so
#: it can be read from anywhere. ``messaging.link`` re-exports both names, which
#: is where the rest of the codebase still reads them from.

#: The channels a PROACTIVE send may name -- ``send_message``'s ``channel_type``

#: each reader: the same subtraction was spelled in three places, which is the
#: drift shape that made a Webex owner DM unreachable while the gateway leg behind
#: it already worked, one level up.
#:
#: Two members of the roster cannot be a send target:
#:
#: * ``slack`` has its own client and streaming path and is deliberately absent
#:   from ``state.channel_transports``, so the shared ladder skips it. It is
#:   spelled ``session="slack"``.
#: * ``unified`` is the session-key bucket ``dm_scope="unified"`` collapses DMs
#:   into, not a transport; no ``ChannelLink`` ever carries it as a channel type.

#: The channels an OWNER-DM may be inferred for -- ``send_message``'s channel
#: ``session`` values. A strict subset of :data:`CHANNEL_SEND_NAMESPACES`, because
#: the two ask different questions and only one of them needs an owner.
#:
#: ``channel_type`` names a conversation: the one the calling session already
#: belongs to, or an explicit ``target_id`` the agent supplies. Neither infers a
#: recipient. A channel ``session`` DOES infer one, from
#: ``configured_targets()`` via ``_owner_dm_target``, whose safety claim is that
#: the agent can only reach somebody the USER configured.
#:
#: ``weixin`` and ``wecom`` are excluded because that claim is false on both. Each
#: folds identities LEARNED from inbound traffic into ``configured_targets()`` --
#: Weixin's ``_known_users`` (``_allowed | _known_users``) and WeCom's
#: ``_warm_chats``, which under ``wecom.allow_all_users`` become the list outright
#: ("there is no configured list to draw on, so the warm peers ARE the list"). So a
#: peer who messaged the bot once can be the single available direct target, which
#: is exactly what ``_owner_dm_target`` reads as "the owner". Nothing downstream
#: catches it: both transports' ``may_send_to`` returns True unconditionally under
#: their open policy (Weixin's promise to consult ``_allowed`` alone holds only on
#: its ``allowlist`` branch), and ``resolve_configured_target`` accepts the learned
#: set too. So private agent output would reach an arbitrary peer, not the operator.
#:
#: The other seven transports draw ``configured_targets()`` from configured state
#: alone; ``test_no_owner_dm_channel_advertises_learned_identities`` is the ratchet
#: that keeps this subtraction honest rather than hand-kept, so a transport that
#: starts mixing learned identities in fails the gate instead of silently becoming
#: an owner-DM target.
#:
#: This is a per-channel CAPABILITY gap, not drift: the exclusion is derived from
#: the send roster and carries its reason, the way ``slack`` and ``unified`` do. A
#: channel graduates by distinguishing configured recipients from learned peers in
#: ``configured_targets()`` -- at which point deleting it from this subtraction is
#: the whole change.
