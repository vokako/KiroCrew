"""Crew Mode — engineered orchestrator pipeline for multi-topic chat.

Design of record: docs/request-for-change/rfc-orchestrator-chat-sessions.md
(v5, post two adversarial council rounds). The user-selected agent runs only
in continuable sub-sessions ("topics"); this manager is the engineered
control plane: durable ingress queue, single-flight decision agent with
structured I/O, validating executor with idempotent dispatch, and verbatim
summary forwarding with mechanical attribution. The LLM only ever chooses
among legal moves — durability, ordering, attribution, and delivery are
owned by code.

Threading contract: everything here runs on the event loop; the only
blocking work (store writes) is small atomic JSON files, mirroring the
subagent ``state.json`` pattern. The decision LLM call is awaited via
``run_bg_oneliner`` (tool-free, timeout-capped).

    The readable fold alone is not unique enough: it preserves case, and a

    and ``foo`` onto ONE directory, so two live slots would share a queue and
    each would route the other's requests. Lower-casing instead would merge them
    outright. The suffix is a digest of the exact key, so any two distinct keys
    get distinct directories on every filesystem while the name stays legible.

    Because the name is therefore NOT the slot key, it cannot be decoded back —
    the key is persisted inside the store and read from there on resume, the same
    way ``chat_utils`` recovers a channel session key from the slot rather than
    from its folded filename.

    The readable half is CAPPED. It is one character per input character, so an
    overlong key produced a directory component past the filesystem's per-name
    limit (255 on POSIX and NTFS alike) and `mkdir` raised ENAMETOOLONG — from a
    slot name, which means the ingress answered 500 instead of accepting the
    request. Truncating costs only legibility: two long keys sharing a prefix
    still get distinct directories, because the digest is taken over the FULL key
    rather than the folded remnant. The cap is well under the limit so the store's
    own children (``queue.json`` and friends) stay inside Windows' 260-char total

    Three ways a folded name fails to be a usable directory:

    * Nothing but dots — see :class:`CrewStore` for why such a name escapes its
      own directory.
    * A TRAILING dot — Win32 strips it from a path segment, so ``crew/foo.`` and
      ``crew/foo`` are ONE directory there. Two distinct slots would then share a
      queue and each would route the other's requests. The dots-only rule (round
      18) does not cover this: ``foo.`` has a real name in front of the dot. A
      trailing SPACE is the same Win32 rule but needs no check here — the charset
      fold above already maps a space to ``_``.
    * A Win32 reserved DEVICE basename (``CON``, ``NUL``, ``COM1`` …), which
      cannot be created at all, so every message on that tab is a 500.

    ``CrewStore`` refuses these too, and that refusal is the LAST line — reached
    only on a crew message, i.e. after the tab exists and the user has typed. The
    entry points (creating a crew slot, switching a slot INTO crew mode) call this
    first so the answer is a clean refusal at the boundary.

    Note these are checked against the READABLE part of the store name, not the
    finished directory name: the digest suffix :func:`_store_name` appends would
    otherwise make every one of them look safe (``crew/..-1a2b3c4d`` traverses
    nothing, ``crew/CON-1a2b3c4d`` is not a device). The suffix does defuse all

        TEMPLATE names ``list_agents()`` reports. The two coincide for every crew
        whose ``kiro_agent`` repeats its own name, which is all of them except
        the default crew: ``default`` binds the template ``kirocrew``. Passing the
        crew name straight through therefore worked by coincidence everywhere

        Resolution is deliberately per dispatch rather than cached on the slot: a

        cache. Falls back to the crew name on any resolution failure, so a broken
        config degrades to the previous behaviour instead of losing the dispatch.

        An UNKNOWN crew name (``requested_resolved`` False) also returns the raw
        crew name rather than the default binding the resolver fell back to:
        dispatching that binding would silently run the default agent under a
        stale name, whereas the crew name is refused by ``_validate_agent`` —
        the unknown-name path stays fail-closed.

        An EMPTY crew also resolves (as ``None``, i.e. the default binding)
        rather than passing ``""`` through: ``spawn()``'s governance agent-scope
        check (``capabilities.spawn.scopes.agents``) only vets a NAMED agent, so
        ``agent=""`` would run the default agent without the administrator's
        allowlist ever seeing it. Resolving pins the concrete template name the

        a bare ``return`` on refusal leaves ``api_chat`` reporting 200, telling a
        programmatic caller (an app) that its message was accepted when nothing

        The append lives here rather than in the caller so that nothing is
        VISIBLE before it is DURABLE: appending in the caller and then awaiting
        this builds the store on a cold slot, and a process exit in that window
        leaves the user looking at their own message with no queue entry behind
        it, a request that could never be resumed.

        Three call sites reach this (`_reconcile`'s scheduled replay, boot
        `_resume_slot`, and a slot reopen in `ingest`) and two of them fire on
        the same restart: `resume_persisted_slots` touches the store — which
        reconciles, scheduling a drain — and then calls `_resume_slot`, which
        drains again. Concurrent drains each snapshot the pending list before
        either removal lands, so every persisted forward was posted TWICE on
        every restart. At-least-once tolerates a duplicate after a crash; it
        does not excuse one by construction. Holding the lock and re-reading
        makes the second caller a no-op instead of a second delivery, and keeps
        any future fourth call site correct without it having to know.
