"""Forwarding a turn to the Kiro Crew backend on loopback.

Everything here follows the backend facts pinned in ``container/CONTRACT.md``:

* Turn endpoint is ``POST /v1/chat/completions`` with ``{model, messages, id,
  stream}``.
* Authenticate with the ``X-Internal-Secret`` header, read from disk **on every
  attempt** via ``common.read_boot_secret``. The secret is ``os.urandom(16)`` per
  boot and is never persisted, so a cached copy 403s silently after a backend
  restart. It is never stored on the client or in a global here.
* The client's ``Origin`` and any ``X-Forwarded-*`` header are never forwarded.
  Rather than copy-and-strip, outbound headers are built from scratch, so a
  header the customer sends cannot reach the backend by accident.
* On a 403, re-read the secret once and retry once, then give up (relay it).
* Every turn runs inside ``transcript.prepared_turn``: the per-slot lock plus the
  on-demand fetch of that one conversation's transcript. The scope is built by
  the caller and entered here on the streaming path, so both transports share one
  definition of "the conversation is present and the slot is ours".
