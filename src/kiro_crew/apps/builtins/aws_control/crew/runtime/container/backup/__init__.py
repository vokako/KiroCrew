"""Track S2: the asynchronous backup sidecar and the restore path.

This is what makes a conversation survive its container. Two public seams,
named in ``container/CONTRACT.md``:

* ``container.backup.sidecar:run_sidecar(settings)`` -- the long-running copier.
* ``container.backup.restore:run_restore(settings)`` -- runs to completion before
  the backend starts; the supervisor (Track S3) calls it.

``backup_status(settings)`` exposes the accepted-but-visible backup lag as a
metric the owner can read.
