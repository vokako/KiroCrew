"""Launching the Kiro Crew backend headless, and knowing when it is ready.

The deployed unit is Kiro Crew's own backend, run in *dashboard mode*, on
loopback, with no interface served (`CHORUS-DOC.md` 4.4, D2). Dashboard mode is
required and `--no-dashboard` is wrong: the smaller ``_init_api_server`` it
starts has neither the chat endpoints nor the slot registry this design calls,
and it quiets nothing, so headless here means "no interface exposed", not
"--no-dashboard".

Launch decisions, all from the contract and design:

- Bind ``common.BACKEND_HOST`` (127.0.0.1, not configurable). The gateway binds
  loopback by default; we also pass it explicitly so the intent is recorded.
- ``--no-crons``. Arming the scheduler fires any *overdue* job immediately, so a
  freshly deployed crew would run a stale job on boot.
- Supply no channel credentials. Every transport is gated on credentials as
  well as its flag, so supplying none keeps them all off without depending on a
  flag. We also strip any channel credential that leaked into the task env.
- ``telemetry.beacon_enabled=false``.
- The boot update check cannot be disabled by config (R4). We do not fight it;
  it is recorded as a known outbound request in the report, not suppressed here.

Readiness means the port answers AND the boot secret file exists. Process-alive
is not ready, and this check deliberately proves no more than that: a present
model key is not a working one, so a container can be "ready" here and still
fail every turn on an invalid key. We do not claim otherwise.

VERIFIED against the installed Kiro Crew (0.3.0) by booting a real
backend through this code on an isolated KIROCREW_HOME (port 8803): the argv
``python -m kiro_crew gateway --no-crons`` boots dashboard mode; ``KIROCREW_PORT``
sets the port (dashboard/urls.py:116), ``KIROCREW_BIND`` pins the address
(urls.py:208), ``KIROCREW_TELEMETRY_DISABLED`` disables the beacon (beacon.py),
the secret lands at ``<KIROCREW_HOME>/run/gateway-<port>.secret`` exactly where
``common.secret_path`` looks, and the listener came up on 127.0.0.1 only.

STILL NOT VERIFIABLE FROM HERE: the backend refuses turns with 503
``kiro_prerequisite_required`` until Kiro CLI is signed in, and this host has no
usable sandbox backend (``unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)`` EPERM), so a real kiro-cli
worker could not be spawned -- the escaped-worker teardown is proven only by the
topology tests, not against a live worker. The boot update check also runs
regardless of config (R4): on this git install it only "notifies", but a
pip-installed container image may make an outbound probe.

#: The variables that hand an AWS credential to anything that reads the environment.
#:
#: On Fargate the task role is not a file or a key: it is an HTTP endpoint named by
#: ``AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI``, which every AWS SDK resolves without being
#: asked. The backend spawns the model subprocess with this environment, and that
#: subprocess auto-approves every tool it calls -- the same premise that
#: already removes ``SMC_CONTROL_SECRET`` below. So a turn could read the URI from its own
#: environment, curl it, and act as the task role: read the transcript bucket, and reach
#: whatever else the role is granted. Keeping it out of the environment closes that
#: independently of the sandbox.
#:
#: Removing them is not a loss for the backend. It talks to the model over
#: ``KIRO_API_KEY`` and to nothing in AWS; the SUPERVISOR is what uses the task role, and
#: it keeps its own ``os.environ`` untouched. A container that genuinely needs an AWS call
#: on the turn path should be given a narrower credential explicitly rather than inherit
#: the task's.
#:
#: ``AWS_CONTAINER_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN`` and the full-URI form are listed too: the newer
#: agent protocol uses them, and a list that only covers the shape in front of us today
#: fails open the day the platform adds another.
