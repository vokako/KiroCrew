"""The restore path: put the authority files in place before the backend starts.

One public seam, ``run_restore(settings)`` (see ``container/CONTRACT.md``). The
supervisor (Track S3) calls it and lets it run to completion BEFORE the backend
process starts. That ordering is a correctness requirement, not a preference:
the backend's periodic flush of ``open_slots.json`` will overwrite whatever is
in place with its in-memory slot table, so any file that lands after the backend
starts is at risk of being erased (design 9.1, ``dashboard_persistence.py``).

Restore downloads the ``config/`` namespace and NOTHING else. A wider scope would
download every object under ``crews/<crew>/``, which put every conversation the
crew had ever had on one task's disk where the backend could read all of them:
isolation is per CREW via the IAM prefix, not per CUSTOMER, so for a crew
serving many customers that was the wrong shape (``EPHEMERAL-CONTRACT.md``).

The property this achieves, stated exactly: **a task only ever holds the
conversations it itself served, and loses them when it exits.** Not "the task
holds nothing" -- the backend's session store IS a filesystem, so a served
conversation is on disk while it is being served. The disk is scratch, not a
store. A reader told nothing is kept, who then finds a jsonl file, has been
misled.

``session_map.json`` and ``open_slots.json`` are the exception, and cannot be
ephemeral: per ``container/common/config.py:120``, without ``session_map.json``
there is no resume at all, and ``open_slots.json`` is the authoritative record
of which conversations exist. They are Kiro Crew's files; we only name their
paths. Both are small, so the restore stays fast.

The backup unit is still ONE unit, so an incomplete set is still reported. A
missing authority file is a degraded boot -- no resume, or no conversation list
-- and restore says so in the returned result and at error level in the log.
Absent transcripts are NOT a degradation: they are absent by design, and the
front process fetches this slot's transcript on demand (Track B).

    conversation list is degraded. ``empty`` (no objects at all under the crew's

    ``transcripts_restored`` must be 0 and is COUNTED, never assumed: it is

    a bulk restore moves the number instead of leaving a hardcoded zero for the

    meaningful -- zero restored out of zero available proves nothing.

    Without this a clean first boot could brick every boot after it, permanently.

    ``iter_backup_files`` yields a config file only ``if f.is_file()``, and the two are
    created at different moments: the slot table appears as soon as the dashboard persists
    one, while the session map is not written until a session is actually mapped. A task
    that took a turn but mapped no session therefore uploads ONE of the two, and the next
    boot reads that bucket as PARTIAL and refuses to start. Refusing means the map is never
    written, so the bucket never gains the second file: the state is absorbing, and only
    deleting the bucket by hand gets out of it.

    Seeding is confined to the EMPTY branch on purpose. Empty means the bucket held nothing
    at all, which is the one state where "an authority file is missing" carries no
    information -- nothing has ever been backed up, so there is nothing for a missing file
    to be evidence of. A bucket that holds objects but lacks an authority file keeps
    refusing, because there the absence is exactly the signal the refusal was built for:
    something was uploaded and one of the two files was lost. That distinction is the whole
    guard, so the seeding must not be hoisted out of this branch to "also fix" the partial
    case.

    ``{}`` is the empty value both readers already accept (``SessionMap._load`` requires a
    dict, and the slot table is persisted as one), so this seeds the state a first boot
    would have reached anyway rather than inventing a new one. An existing file is never
