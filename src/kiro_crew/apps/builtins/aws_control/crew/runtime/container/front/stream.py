"""Customer stream projection for the backend's OpenAI-compatible turn SSE.

VERIFIED against a real Kiro Crew backend (isolated home on :8801):
``POST /v1/chat/completions`` with ``stream=true`` emits an **OpenAI** event
stream, NOT the ACP ``sessionUpdate`` vocabulary:

  * ``data: {chat.completion.chunk}`` frames carrying ``choices[].delta.content``
    -- assistant text only. The backend already applies credential/exfil-URL
    redaction to this content (``openai_compat._redact``), and its collector
    forwards ONLY ``assistant``/``chunk`` roles, so tool params, agent reasoning
    and usage never appear on this endpoint.
  * ``: keepalive`` comment frames (every ~30s of quiet).
  * a terminal ``data: [DONE]``.
  * on failure, ``data: {"error": {...}}`` then ``data: [DONE]``.
  * NO SSE ``event:`` names anywhere.

The ACP event kinds the design's streaming contract enumerates -- and the
undocumented ``tool_result`` leak it warns about -- belong to the OWNER control
stream (``GET /sessions/{cid}/stream``), a surface the front process does NOT
serve. An event-NAME allowlist (the earlier build) drops every frame here and
hands the customer an empty turn.

So the projection fails closed at the FRAME-CONTENT level. A frame is relayed
only if it is: a keepalive comment, the ``[DONE]`` sentinel, a well-formed
``chat.completion.chunk``, or an OpenAI ``error`` object. Anything else -- a
non-chunk JSON object, non-JSON data, or a frame carrying an SSE ``event:`` name
(which this endpoint never emits) -- is dropped. If a future backend change ever
interleaves a named ACP event onto this endpoint, it fails closed rather than
leaking.
