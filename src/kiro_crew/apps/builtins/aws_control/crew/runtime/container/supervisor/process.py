"""Launching and tearing down a child as a process *group*.

The container runs a small tree of long-lived children. One of them, the
Kiro Crew backend, itself launches ``kiro-cli`` workers, and each worker is a
two-process tree: a launcher and the child that actually runs the turn.
Signalling the launcher's pid alone orphans that child, which goes on to finish
its turn against a data home the container is trying to shut down.

So every child here is started in its own session with ``start_new_session``,
which makes the child a session and group leader whose process-group id equals
its pid. Grandchildren inherit that group, and a single ``killpg`` reaches the
whole tree. Teardown *drains*: it asks the group to stop with SIGTERM, waits for
the group leader to exit, and only escalates to SIGKILL if the drain window
elapses.
