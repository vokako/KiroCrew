"""Mapping between the on-disk backup unit and flat S3 object keys.

The backup unit (``Settings.backup_unit``) is a mix of directories and single
files that live under two independent roots: ``data_home`` (transcripts,
archive, artifacts) and ``config_dir`` (``session_map.json``, ``open_slots.json``).
This module is the one place that decides how a local path becomes an object
key and how a key becomes a local path again. Backup and restore MUST agree on
that decision, so both go through here rather than each inventing a scheme.

Keys carry a two-namespace prefix so the two roots never collide even when
``config_dir`` is nested inside ``data_home`` (the default):

    data/<path relative to data_home>       e.g. data/sessions/<sid>.jsonl
    config/<path relative to config_dir>    e.g. config/session_map.json

The full S3 key additionally carries ``<backup_prefix>/<crew_name>/`` so one
bucket can hold many crews. ``rel`` keys (namespace + relative path) are what
the local change-tracking state records, because they are stable regardless of
where the bucket or crew prefix moves.
