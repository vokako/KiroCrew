"""Install the crew bundle into the paths Kiro Crew actually reads, or refuse.

The crew rides in the image at ``/app/crew-bundle`` (PACKAGING-CONTRACT.md, T3).
The previous design uploaded it to S3 and nothing in the container ever read it,
so ten gates went green while the deployment served a default agent. This module
closes that by construction: the supervisor installs the bundle BEFORE the
backend starts, and refuses to boot unless the named crew is the one installed.

WHERE EACH ENTRY GOES -- verified against the Kiro Crew source at
a Kiro Crew source checkout (0.6.0), not inferred from a plausible
name. ``config_dir()`` and ``data_home()`` resolve to the SAME directory, so a
``<home>/config/`` guess would land two of these where nothing reads them:

* ``agent.json`` -> ``<kiro home>/agents/<crew_name>.json``.
  ``agent_discovery.list_agents`` is THE reader of installed agent specs, keyed by
  the spec's ``name``, and it reads and JSON-parses every ``~/.kiro/agents/*.json``
  on each call. The gateway resolves that directory as ``kiro_home() / "agents"``,
  where ``kiro_home()`` is ``$KIRO_HOME`` or ``~/.kiro``. It is NOT under the data
  home and NOT governed by ``KIROCREW_HOME``: the backend is launched with
  ``KIROCREW_HOME=data_home`` but no ``KIRO_HOME`` (``supervisor/backend.py``),
  so the spec lands under the process HOME. Resolved here the same way rather
  than imported, so this module needs no ``kiro_crew`` install (matching the
  supervisor's other minimal, import-free config reads).

  The gateway's chain reaches that path through a private override-BLIND helper,
  which ``test_host_isolation_floor.py::test_the_ambient_resolver_has_exactly_one_caller``
  keeps to a fixed set of callers. This module is not one of them and must not
  become one, so it is named here by what it computes rather than by its symbol:
  a source-text guard cannot tell a docstring from a call, and it is right not to
  try.

* ``mcp.json`` -> ``<data home>/mcp.json``. The Kiro Crew-scope MCP config is
  ``data_home()/"mcp.json"`` -- the highest-priority source in
  ``mcp_discovery._mcp_sources`` (``mcp_discovery.py:297``,
  ``SCOPE_KIROCREW``) and what ``dashboard/handlers/mcp.py:1620``
  (``_kirocrew_mcp_json`` -> ``data_home()/"mcp.json"``) reads for its
  ``mcpServers`` (``:704``).

* ``skills/`` -> ``<data home>/skills/``. ``skills.py:1422`` ``skills_dir()`` is
  ``config_dir() / SKILLS_DIR_NAME`` and ``SKILLS_DIR_NAME == "skills"``
  (``skills.py:49``); ``config_dir()`` (``config/paths.py:265``) honours
  ``KIROCREW_HOME``, so in the container this is ``<data home>/skills``.

THE DIGEST is recomputed here byte-identically to the producer
(``share-my-crew/build/export/crew_export/bundle.py:78`` ``_bundle_digest``) and
its independent verifier (``build/export/tools/verify_bundle.py:50``
``digest_of``), which agree exactly. A different serialisation would fail every
valid bundle, so ``_content_digest`` is copied verbatim rather than reinvented.
