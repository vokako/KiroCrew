"""Putting ONE conversation's transcript on disk, at the turn that needs it.

Boot downloads recent transcripts only, not every one the crew has ever had (see
``EPHEMERAL-CONTRACT.md``): a task starts with the two authority files and no
conversations at all. This module is the other half of that change. Before a
turn reaches the backend, the one transcript that turn continues is fetched.

The property the pair achieves, stated exactly: *a task only ever holds the
conversations it itself served, and loses them when it exits.*

Each rule below is a way this goes wrong silently, so each is enforced by
construction rather than by review.

* **One object, never a list.** The reader this module talks to has no ``list``
  and no ``put`` (:class:`TranscriptReader`), so listing the prefix is not a
  thing this code path can do. A single list would undo the whole change at the
  first turn.
* **Absent is NORMAL.** A new conversation has no transcript yet, and its first
  turn must proceed.
* **Already on disk means this task already served it.** Do not re-fetch and do
  not overwrite: the local copy is newer than S3 by up to one backup interval,
  so overwriting rolls a customer's conversation backwards. The write uses
  ``os.link`` onto the target, which FAILS if the target exists, so
  "never overwrite" is a filesystem guarantee and not a check that a later edit
  can quietly drop.
* **A fetch that fails FAILS THE TURN.** A customer whose conversation appears
  forgotten is worse than an error, and the damage is worse than it first looks:
  the backend would create a fresh transcript holding only this turn, and the
  sidecar replaces whole objects (``container/backup/store.py`` ``put``), so the
  next backup cycle would overwrite the customer's entire history in S3. The
  failure is :class:`TranscriptUnavailable`, surfaced with its own error code.
* **Never log a transcript's contents.** The sid and the byte count only.

**The filename, which is the part that was found the hard way.** The object is
``<thread>_<slot>.jsonl``, not ``<slot>.jsonl``, and for this deployment the
thread is always ``dashboard``. Verified in the Kiro Crew wheel this image ships
(``vendor/kirocrew-0.6.0-py3-none-any.whl``):

* ``dashboard/openai_compat.py:257`` takes the turn's ``id`` as the slot id and
  ``:296`` resolves it through ``state.get_or_create_slot``, which normalizes
  with ``dashboard/state.py:_normalize_slot_key``.
* That function's docstring states the invariant a restart depends on:
  ``_safe_key(_history_key_for(key)) == f"dashboard_{key}"``. So the transcript
  stem is the slot key with a ``dashboard_`` prefix, and the file is
  ``<sessions_dir>/dashboard_<slot>.jsonl``.
* ``control/observe.py resolve_open_slots`` documents the same mapping from the
  other side, plus the verbatim form (``weixin_...``) that belongs to a
  channel-born conversation. No channel credentials are supplied to this
  container (``container/CONTRACT.md``), so every conversation here is a
  dashboard slot and the thread is not ambiguous.

``_normalize_slot_key`` is mirrored rather than imported: the wheel is a vendored
artifact the front process does not import from, and the mapping is three lines.
:func:`transcript_stem` is pinned against the values in those two sources by
``tests/test_front_transcript_fetch.py``.

Archived segments (``sessions/archive/**``) are deliberately NOT fetched: finding
them requires listing, which is the one thing this path may not do. Rotation
keeps the recent window in the live transcript, so a turn continues from the live
object; older segments stay in S3 and remain readable by the owner's control
plane, which has credentials of its own.
