"""Two findings from review on this change, each pinned so a revert reddens.

**The task role reached the model process.** ``build_backend_env`` already drops the
front's control secret, on the premise that the backend spawns the model subprocess, which
inherits this environment and auto-approves every tool it calls (see
``test_backend_env_drops_control_secret``). The same premise covers the task role, and it
was not being dropped. On Fargate that credential is not a file or a key but an HTTP
endpoint named by ``AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI``, which every AWS SDK resolves
unasked, so a turn could read the variable from its own environment and act as the task
role.

**The 400 body returned ``str(exc)``.** Harmless while one raise site holds an authored
message, and wrong the first time someone writes ``BadForwardField(f"...{inner}")``: the
response would carry whatever the inner exception says about the container, on a line whose
reviewer is not looking at the response path. ``detail`` names the caller-facing channel so
the decision sits where it is made.

The third finding on this change is about PACKAGING -- that no published wheel carried this
tree, because ``python -m build`` builds the wheel from the sdist and ``MANIFEST.in``
reached none of these files. It is pinned in ``test/test_crew_runtime_payload.py`` rather
than here: this suite's subject is the image, which runs on an installed copy where there
is no repository and no ``MANIFEST.in`` to read.
