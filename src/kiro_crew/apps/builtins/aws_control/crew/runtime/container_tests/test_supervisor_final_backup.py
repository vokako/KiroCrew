"""Shutdown must upload once more, and only where that means something.

A task replacement is not a rare event: it happens on every deploy, every failed
health check and every platform update. The periodic sidecar cycle runs on a
timer, so a turn finishing between the last cycle and SIGTERM was never uploaded,
and the backend's own 25s drain flushes MORE state after that cycle. Without a
final pass the newest conversation is lost every time the task is replaced.

The ordering is the part worth testing rather than the mere existence of the
call: the cycle must run after the front and backend are drained (nothing is
writing) AND after the sidecar is stopped (exactly one writer). A final cycle
racing a live sidecar over the same keys would be a fix that introduced its own
defect.
