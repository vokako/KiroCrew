"""The backend must not hand the front's control secret to the model subprocess.

``build_backend_env`` copies the task environment wholesale. That environment holds
``SMC_CONTROL_SECRET``, injected by the ECS task definition from Secrets Manager for
the FRONT to validate the ``X-SMC-Control-Secret`` header with. The backend never
reads it -- but the backend spawns the model subprocess, which inherits its
environment and auto-approves every tool it calls. So a prompt able to read its own
environment could lift the secret and then call the front's control endpoints as the
control plane; dropping it from the backend env closes that independently of the
sandbox.
