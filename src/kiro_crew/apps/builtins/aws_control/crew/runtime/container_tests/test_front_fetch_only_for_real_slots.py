"""A turn the backend will refuse must not put a conversation on this disk.

Found by an adversarial cross-model review of the ephemeral change, reproduced
before fixing. The front proxies a turn and the BACKEND decides whether an id is
legal, so the fetch runs first. ``id="dashboard:cust-1"`` is not a legal backend
id (``kiro_crew.session_storage._UNIT_ID_RE`` has no colon in its class), but the
fold turns it into ``dashboard_cust-1``, which names a real conversation. The old
code downloaded that transcript and the backend then rejected the turn, leaving
the task holding a conversation it never served. That is the exact property the
ephemeral change exists to establish, defeated by one punctuation mark.

The second half is the alias lock. ``cust-1`` and ``dashboard_cust-1`` are one
conversation and one file, but the serializer was keyed on the raw string, so the
two spellings took two different locks while reporting one turn per slot.
