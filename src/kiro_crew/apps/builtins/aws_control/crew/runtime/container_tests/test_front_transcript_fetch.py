"""The on-demand transcript fetch: the other half of the ephemeral memory change.

Boot restores no transcripts, so THIS is where a returning customer's
conversation comes back (``EPHEMERAL-CONTRACT.md``). Every test here pins a rule
whose violation is silent in production:

1. The object is ``dashboard_<slot>.jsonl``, not ``<slot>.jsonl``. Getting this
   wrong fetches nothing and every customer looks new, with no error anywhere.
2. Exactly ONE key is requested, ever. A list undoes the isolation the change
   exists for.
3. A transcript already on disk is never re-fetched and never overwritten. The
   local copy leads S3 by up to one backup interval, so an overwrite rolls a
   customer's conversation backwards.
4. Absence is normal; a FAILURE fails the turn on both transports, before the
   body reaches the backend.
5. Contents are never logged.

No AWS: the reader is a fake with a ``get``. The backend is the same fake HTTP
surface ``test_front_proxy.py`` uses, imported rather than rebuilt so the two
files cannot model different backends.
