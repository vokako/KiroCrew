"""Two fixes, each pinned so reverting it reddens.

Both were found by a review bot on code that already had a guard nearby, which
is why they are worth naming precisely rather than filing as "hardening".

* Restore chose which objects to write with a NAMESPACE predicate. The task role
  can write to this bucket in persistent mode, so any object it uploads under
  ``config/`` was restored on the next boot -- including one that governs the
  agent itself. The sibling test ``test_only_the_config_namespace_is_written``
  says "namespace" in its own name and passed the whole time, because a
  namespace was exactly what the code enforced.

* The transcript write ran on the event loop, one line after a comment
  explaining why the FETCH must not.
