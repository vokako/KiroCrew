"""A chatbot crew must not start a sidecar, because starting one is a boot loop.

``run_sidecar`` logs and returns when no bucket is configured, and
``_wait_for_shutdown`` treats ANY child exiting as the end of the task. Together
those two reasonable behaviours make an unconditional sidecar fatal in chatbot
mode: the container comes up, loses its sidecar within a second, shuts down, and
ECS replaces it, forever. Nothing in the deploy would say why, because each piece
is behaving as designed.

The supervisor tests must not run with ``backup_bucket=None`` and assert that the
sidecar starts, so the suite encoded the boot loop as correct. That is why these
tests exist separately: they assert the mode, not the wiring.
