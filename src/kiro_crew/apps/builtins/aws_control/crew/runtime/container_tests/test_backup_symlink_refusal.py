"""Backup uploads real files inside its root, and nothing a link points at.

This is the WRITE direction of a defect class this branch already fixed twice on
the read side, and the write direction is worse: a link the backup follows sends
whatever it points at to the owner's bucket, where it persists.

The agent writes into this tree -- that is what the artifacts directory is for --
and the container's backend auto-approves every tool, because an unattended crew
cannot stall on an approval nobody will see. So a planted symlink is a reachable
input, not a hypothetical one. A link named like an artifact and pointing at
``/proc/self/environ`` would upload the task's own credentials.

``os.walk(followlinks=False)`` is not enough on its own, which is the trap: it
refuses to DESCEND through a directory symlink, but it still lists a symlinked
directory in ``dirnames`` and a symlinked FILE in ``filenames``, and reading one
follows it.
