"""The supervisor's exit code is the only signal the platform reads.

``run()`` ended with an unconditional ``return 0`` after teardown, so a task whose
backend had crashed reported the same status as one ECS had asked to stop. On the
console that is a task exiting normally, over and over, with nothing marked failed --
the crash loop is invisible exactly when it matters.

Nothing asserted the return value before, which is how it survived: the whole
supervisor suite passed with the bug in place.
