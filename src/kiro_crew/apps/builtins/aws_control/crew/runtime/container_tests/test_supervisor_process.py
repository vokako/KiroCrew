# caller's next act is ``_final_backup_cycle`` -- so a worker that survived is still
# writing while its own transcript is uploaded.

# The asymmetry was visible inside the function. The drain path carried the comment
# "Leader drained; sweep the group in case a grandchild lingers", which is the same state
# the early return was in, reaching the opposite conclusion.
