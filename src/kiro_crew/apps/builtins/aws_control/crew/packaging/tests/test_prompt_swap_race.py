"""A prompt file swapped for a link AFTER the fences pass must not be read.

``_resolve_prompt_path`` applies every prompt fence -- pseudo-filesystem, the repo's
sensitive-path predicate, the credential name and location checks -- against a PATH,
and then the caller opened that path again. The agents directory is writable, so the
entry can become a link to a credential file in between, and the bundle would carry
the target's bytes with every fence reporting a pass.

The reader now opens once with ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and reads from that descriptor, so the
checks are binding rather than advisory. These tests stage the swap directly.
