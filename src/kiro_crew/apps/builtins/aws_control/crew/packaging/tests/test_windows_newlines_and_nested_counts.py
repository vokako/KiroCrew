"""Two defects a Linux-only run cannot see, and one the shape of a count hid.

All three came from review, not from this suite. For the newline pair the reason is the
same in both directions: the suite wrote its fixtures through the very call that was
wrong, so the fixture and the output were corrupted together and the comparison stayed
green.

**Newline translation.** ``Path.write_text(text, encoding="utf-8")`` leaves ``newline`` at
``None``, which translates every ``"\\n"`` to ``os.linesep`` on write. On Windows that adds
a ``"\\r"`` to every line of every file the builder stages, and two things break. The
content pin compares ``_tree_hash`` (SOURCE bytes) with ``_staged_tree_hash`` (SHIPPED
bytes), so an ordinary LF-authored skill hashes differently once staged and the build
refuses with "changed while the bundle was being written" -- fail-closed, but it aborts
every Windows build of a normal crew. And ``bundle_digest`` runs over those same staged
bytes, so one crew reports different digests depending on the platform that built it.

Reproducing that on Linux needs the translation itself, which no argument to the builder
can turn on. ``load_build(mutate=...)`` is how this suite already substitutes one
construct to observe what a guard prevents, so the test below swaps the pinned writer for
a translating one and asserts the build then refuses. That is the actual Windows failure,
observable on the platform CI mostly runs.

**Nested skill ids.** A skill id is ``relative_to(skills_root).as_posix()`` and may contain
a separator, so ``aws/ec2`` and ``aws/s3`` are two skills under one top-level ``aws``
directory. Counting top-level directories reported ``skill_count == 1`` for that pair, in
the printed summary and in ``SMC_BUNDLE_JSON`` alike.
