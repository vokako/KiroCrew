"""Entry shapes at derived paths, and preflight ordering.

T1 the report refusal ran AFTER build_bundle -- so it refused a foreign report only once
   staging had been built, the previous bundle moved aside, staging renamed into place and the
   aside copy deleted. A preflight that runs after the thing it guards is a message.

T2 the aside path had no redirect check -- ``staging`` and ``out_dir`` got one an earlier round
   and ``<out>.previous`` did not, so a redirect there aimed the ownership check AND the
   rmtree below it at somewhere else, and the check passed because it examined the target.

T3 the report check's own preflight used ``is_file()`` first, which follows a link -- and on
   Windows follows a reparse point naming a share, which is the outbound SMB probe, from a
   path derived from --out.

T4 the agent spec was read with no sensitive-path check, while the prompt reference beside it
   had one. The spec's bytes SHIP, as ``agent.json``, so the read reaches the customer just as
   directly as an inlined prompt.

A fifth finding is REJECTED with evidence; see
``test_the_carried_plan_is_deliberately_outside_the_digest``.
