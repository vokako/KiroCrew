"""The five findings the GPT lane raised once its adjudication could run.

All five are the same shape of defect and it is worth naming: the builder exists to stop
untrusted crew content reaching a place it should not, and each of these was a path or a
field it trusted on the way. Each test below reddens if its fix is reverted, and each
mutation is pointed at the exact construct rather than at a substring that also appears
elsewhere.

F1 ``_write_marker_exclusive`` -- the staging marker was written with ``write_text``, so a
   symlink pre-planted at ``<out>.staging.owned`` was followed and its target truncated.

F2 ``_validated_crew_name`` -- ``source / "agents" / f"{name}.json"`` let ``--crew`` carry
   separators, ``..`` or an absolute path, so the spec read came from outside the source.
   Operator-supplied rather than attacker-supplied, so hardening rather than a breach.

F3 ``_open_root_nofollow`` -- the anchor root of the per-component ``O_NOFOLLOW`` walk was
   itself opened following links, so swapping ``<source>/agents`` for a link made every
   check below verify the wrong tree carefully.

F4 ``_marker_is_ours`` -- ownership was ``staging_marker.is_file()``, true of any plain
   file, and it authorised ``shutil.rmtree``. The aside-directory path accepted a
   plan-only directory on the FILENAME alone.

F5 ``build_spec`` -- a non-list ``tools`` skipped the isinstance branch and then hit
   ``set(spec.get("tools") or [])``, raising an uncaught ``TypeError``.
