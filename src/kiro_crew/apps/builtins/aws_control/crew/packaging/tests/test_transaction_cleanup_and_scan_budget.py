"""Transaction cleanup, and a scan budget that fails closed.

X1 the report was written by the CALLER, after ``build_bundle`` had renamed the previous
   bundle aside and deleted it. So a report write that failed left a non-zero exit code, no
   report, and the operator's previous bundle gone -- a failure that had already replaced what
   it was going to replace. Everything the report says is known before the swap, so it is
   written there, inside the transaction that restores the previous bundle.

X2 the carried plan was read OUTSIDE the cleanup transaction, so an unreadable plan raised a
   bare ``OSError`` past every handler and stranded the staging tree AND its marker. The marker
   is the worse half: it is what authorises the next run's recursive delete.

X3 the base64 decode budget skipped what it could not afford and said nothing. ``break`` let
   one oversized run disable the scan and ``continue`` fixed that, but both reported unscanned
   content as clean. It now appends a finding naming what was not read.
