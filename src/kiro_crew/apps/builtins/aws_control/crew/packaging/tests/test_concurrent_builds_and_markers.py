"""Two concurrent builds, and what the staging marker may claim.

U1 the agent spec's redirect check judged only the FINAL component, so a junction at
   ``<source>/agents`` was traversed by the ``is_file()`` below it. Same mistake the prompt
   fence made in its first version, and the same function fixes it -- which is the point:
   there was already a whole-chain walker, and this call site used the single-entry predicate.

U2 the staging marker said "a kiro-crew build made this" and nothing more, so two concurrent
   builds against one --out each read the OTHER's marker as their own and deleted the other's
   staging tree with the recursive delete the marker authorises.
