"""An external prompt reference is refused, and the refusal says what to do instead.

Reading a ``file://`` prompt safely means resolving an operator-supplied path without
following a redirect, on two platforms with different link semantics, before any resolution can
reach the network. That is ~350 lines whose review found 20+ separate defects across seven
rounds while the rest of this module was settled, so it ships as its own change.

This file pins the limitation so it is a decision rather than a gap: the build refuses, the
message is actionable, and nothing silently produces a crew that answers as nobody.
