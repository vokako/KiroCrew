"""The third and last recursive-delete site: ``<out>.staging``.

Three paths in ``build_bundle`` delete a directory recursively, and each carries a
different subset of the same rule. ``--out`` and ``<out>.previous`` share one function;
staging cannot use it, because staging is filled in incrementally and its manifest is
written near the end, so a directory this build abandoned legitimately has no digest to
verify.

What staging has instead is that this build CREATES it. So it leaves a marker beside it, and
a directory without one was made by someone else whatever it contains. Before that, the name
and shape rules were satisfied by an operator's own directory: ``skills`` is a name the build
writes, so ``<out>.staging/skills/notes.txt`` passed the top-level check and the recursive
delete removed notes.txt.

The marker sits BESIDE staging rather than inside it because ``bundle_digest(staging)`` is a
frozen contract value computed over everything in there -- a file inside would either change
that digest or ship inside the bundle.
