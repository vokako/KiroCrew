"""The prompt fence must judge the RESOLVED target, not the path as written.

A review pass pointed at the read in ``_inline_prompt`` and proposed routing it
through the repository's guarded reader. Investigating that turned up a sharper
hole than the example given, and reproducing it first is what identified the
right fix:

    refused_by_location(link)           -> False   (the link's own path is fine)
    refused_by_location(link.resolve()) -> True    (its target is a kubeconfig)

so a symlink inside the agents directory pointing at ``~/.kube/config`` passed a
fence added specifically to refuse that file, and the read followed the link.

What this deliberately does NOT do is require the resolved path to stay under
``agents_dir``. That would also close the hole, but by breaking a supported case:
an absolute persona path outside that directory has its own passing test. Closing
a hole by removing a documented feature is not a fix.
