"""Track B pins for the packager: the sensitive-path fence and the plan's
``include`` truthiness.

Both are mutation-tested against ``packaging/build.py`` through the same
exec-load harness the rest of this suite uses (``test_producer.load_build``): the
guard's source is disabled in a throwaway copy of the module and the same
scenario is shown to leak, so each assertion proves the guard is load-bearing
rather than decorative. See that module's ``load_build`` docstring for why a
module-level guard has to be mutation-tested by compiling a variant of the source.
