"""Tests for the crew bundle producer.

Two things need proving: the four-entry bundle comes out in the right shape, and
the deny-by-default guards actually refuse. The guards are the part whose failure
ships a credential, so each one is MUTATION-tested: the guard's source line is
disabled in an exec-loaded copy of the module and the same scenario is shown to
leak, proving the guard is load-bearing rather than decorative.

The module is loaded by exec-ing its file under a throwaway name rather than
``import packaging`` -- the environment also carries the unrelated PyPA ``packaging``
distribution, and a top-level ``import packaging`` would collide. The CLI end-to-end
test runs ``python -m packaging.build`` in a subprocess whose cwd is the crew root,
where this directory's ``packaging`` shadows the site-packages one for that child
only. That cwd is the driver's contract, not a test convenience: see
``smc-deploy.sh``'s ``cd "$CREW_ROOT" && "$py" -m packaging.build``.

Run only this file:
    python -m pytest \
        src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins/aws_control/crew/packaging/tests/test_producer.py -q

    made the interpreter write ``__pycache__`` directories into the source tree
