"""A plain FILE at ``--out`` or at the staging path must be refused, not crashed on.

``Path.exists()`` is true for a file, so the two residue scans that follow it --
``staging.rglob("*")`` and ``out_dir.iterdir()`` -- raised an uncaught
``NotADirectoryError``. Reproduced for each before this suite existed, and in both cases the
staging directory was left on disk by the crash, so a retry then met leftovers it had to
reason about.

The refusal is the same answer the residue scans already give for content the build does not
own; it just has to arrive BEFORE anything is created. Both halves are asserted on the
outcome the caller sees -- a clean ``ExportRefused`` -- and on the disk being left alone.
