"""An absolute persona OUTSIDE the agents directory is a supported case.

``_resolve_prompt_path`` says so in its own body: "Containment under agents_dir is
deliberately NOT required: an absolute persona path outside that directory is a supported
case with its own test."

The parent-swap fix broke it. That fix reads the prompt through a descendant-wise opener
anchored at a trusted root, and it passed ``agents_dir`` unconditionally -- so an absolute
path that cannot be relativized to ``agents_dir`` aborted the whole bundle with "is not
under the agents directory". Reproduced before this suite existed.

The anchor is now derived from the path: ``agents_dir`` for a prompt inside it, the path's
own parent otherwise. The two buy different things on purpose, and both halves are pinned
here, because a fix that quietly widened the protected set would be the same defect in the
other direction.
