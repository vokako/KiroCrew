"""``python -m packaging.build`` -- curate a local crew into a deployable bundle.

WHY THIS IS A PORT, NOT A COPY
------------------------------
``PACKAGING-CONTRACT.md`` (T1) says to port ``bundle.py`` + ``bundle_source.py``
from ``share-my-crew/build/serving/smc/`` and that those files "carry
``reviewed_by`` / ``reviewed_at`` and a content-hash recheck". Read in full,
they do NOT: ``serving/smc/bundle.py`` is the container's READER (it validates a
bundle at startup) and ``serving/smc/bundle_source.py`` is the S3 FETCH that the
top-level contract explicitly DELETES. Neither enumerates a crew, neither
curates, and neither carries a review signature or a content pin.

The deny-by-default producer the contract describes is
``share-my-crew/build/export/crew_export/`` -- ``candidates.py`` (enumeration,
everything starts excluded), ``plan.py`` (the ``reviewed_by`` / ``reviewed_at``
signature and the per-item sha256 content pin), ``spec.py`` (prompt inlining and
tool/MCP normalisation) and ``bundle.py`` (the layout writer and the digest the
contract points at: ``_bundle_digest``). This module ports THAT, because a port
of the named files would ship no curation at all -- and "a port that loosens
this is worse than no port".

The port is self-contained on purpose. ``crew_export`` imports
``kiro_crew.config.paths``, ``kiro_crew.knowledge.store``,
``kiro_crew.deploy.scan`` and ``kiro_crew.security``; NONE of those are importable
in this app's venv (it carries boto3 / fastapi / pydantic / pytest only, and no
PyYAML), so the curation plan is JSON rather than YAML and the credential
scanner is a self-contained subset of ``kiro_crew.deploy.scan`` -- see
``_HARD_PATTERNS`` and the report note about it.

THE DENY-BY-DEFAULT SEAM, PRESERVED
-----------------------------------
A skill or MCP server enters the bundle ONLY when a signed review says so and its
content still matches what was reviewed. Two guards, both from
``crew_export/plan.py``:

* **The signature.** ``reviewed_by`` and ``reviewed_at`` start blank; a review
  file that selects anything while either is blank is refused. There is no flag
  to skip review -- a flag fails open when forgotten. Running with no ``--allow``
  at all is a valid outcome: an empty-but-valid bundle (persona + tools, no
  private skills, no owner MCP servers), so the failure direction is
  under-sharing.
* **The content pin.** Every reviewed entry records the sha256 of the content it
  was written from, and the build re-checks that hash for each SELECTED entry. A
  skill or server edited after approval refuses the build and is named.
  Yesterday's approval cannot be laundered across today's content.

INTERFACE (PACKAGING-CONTRACT.md T1)
------------------------------------
    python -m packaging.build --crew <name> --out <dir> [--allow <path>]...
    python -m packaging.build plan  --crew <name> --out <dir> [--allow <path>]...

``build`` (the default verb) writes the four-entry layout into ``<dir>`` and
prints, as the LAST line, ``SMC_BUNDLE_JSON=<path>`` naming a JSON file with
``crew_name``, ``bundle_dir``, ``digest``, ``skill_count``, ``mcp_servers`` and
``denied``. ``plan`` prints the same decision set and writes a fresh
deny-by-default review template, WITHOUT writing a bundle.

``--crew`` names the crew; its source is a "crew home" holding
``agents/<name>.json`` and ``skills/``. ``--source`` overrides that root (a test
points it at a fixture); by default the agent spec resolves under
``$KIRO_HOME`` / ``~/.kiro`` and skills under ``$KIROCREW_HOME`` -- the same
locations Kiro Crew uses (``kiro_crew/config/paths.py:604`` ``kiro_agents_dir`` =
``kiro_home()/agents``, ``:510`` ``kiro_home``; ``config_dir()/skills`` per
``crew_export/candidates.py``). Never defaults to a temp dir.
