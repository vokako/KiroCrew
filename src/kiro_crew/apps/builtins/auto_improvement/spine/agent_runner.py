"""Headless ``claude -p`` agent runner — the *intelligent* step of the loop.

Ported from the original framework's ``autoloop/claude_runner.py`` (which produced
17 perf + 18 bug draft CRs). The autonomous loop uses the model only for the steps
that need judgement — author a bug fix (reproducing test + source edit) inside an
isolated worktree, or refine a perf edit. Orchestration, gating (build + RED→GREEN /
A-B noise band), verification, dedup, and CR drafting stay deterministic Python in the
spine; THIS is the one place a model is invoked.

The runner is a thin subprocess wrapper that:
  - runs ``claude -p`` with a prompt (cwd'd into the candidate worktree),
  - bypasses interactive permission prompts (the worktree is throwaway + isolated and
    the clone is push-disabled — the blast radius is contained by gating + no-push),
  - enforces a timeout, accumulates cost so the driver's ``--max-cost`` ceiling is live,
  - NEVER raises on model-side failure (returns a result the caller inspects).

It is OPTIONAL and INJECTED: the spine works headless/offline without it (the offline
profile's ``propose`` realizes mechanical perf seeds and the bug ``propose`` returns
False = "awaiting the agent edit"). When a runner is wired (the backend app passes one),
bug candidates get a real authored fix and the loop produces real draft CRs — matching
the original framework end-to-end.

    agent is UNATTENDED and its prompt embeds outsider-writable PR-comment text, so an

    Routing every request through the same ``HookManager`` the dashboard/Slack paths use

    Kiro Crew config selects (whichever LLM provider backend the user configured), so ANY
    backend can power the autonomous loop — not just a single CLI on PATH.

    It matches :class:`AgentRunner`'s surface exactly (``run`` → :class:`AgentResult`,
    ``available``, ``total_cost_usd``, ``stop_check``, ``on_activity``), so it is a drop-in
    where the spine constructs a runner. Internally it bridges the spine's SYNC ``run`` to
    the provider's ASYNC ``stream``: it spawns the provider cwd'd into the throwaway
    worktree, streams the task, auto-approves ONLY the allowlisted tools, accumulates the
    assistant text + cost, and honors stop/timeout — then tears the provider down.

    SAFETY / PERMISSIONS: the subagent runs UNATTENDED, so it AUTO-APPROVES every tool/MCP
    the provider requests — blocking on a permission prompt would stall the loop (and there
    is no human to answer). This is safe because the blast radius is already contained: the
    agent works ONLY inside the throwaway, push-disabled worktree, and the spine's edit
    allowlist + RED→GREEN / A-B gate decide what actually ships. It is the session-layer

    Returns True iff the agent left a real diff. Never trusts the agent's claim of a
    speedup: the keeper requires the measured delta to clear the calibrated noise band,
    reproduced by a SECOND independent A/B, with the suite-still-passes guardrail and the
    test-count reward-hack guard both holding. So an imagined win costs one bounded
    cycle, never a fabricated keep.

    SAFETY: edits land only in the throwaway worktree; the edit allowlist forbids the
    tests-of-record (the ruler's own measurement subject) and the build/CI config, and
    the clone cannot push.
