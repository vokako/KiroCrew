"""Driver — the external durable while-loop owning git + archive state (spine).

The outer layer of the two-layer architecture (02_architecture.md §1, §6.1; 10_roadmap
M0 "driver — the external while-loop owning durable state (git branch + results/
archive), budget caps, and the quiescence stop"). A plain Python while-loop that is
cron/tmux-restartable and survives Claude restarts, because its ONLY durable state is:

  - the git working branch in the separate push-disabled clone (current best == HEAD), and
  - the ``results/`` archive on disk (the whole candidate population + run metadata).

Per cycle it (02_arch §1 diagram, §6.1):
  1. reads branch HEAD + the top-K archive (evolutionary memory),
  2. invokes ONE per-cycle workflow: discover (A) → propose (B) → gate (C) →
     measure (D) → keep/revert (E),
  3. applies the verdict — commit-on-keep (local only) / leave-on-discard — and
     appends a results row + dedups via the ledger,
  4. drafts a CR on a kept, reproduced win,
  5. loops until budget (``--max-cycles`` / ``--max-hours`` / ``--max-cost``) or
     quiescence (M consecutive cycles with no keep).

SAFETY (M0 exit criterion; 08_safety §1.3): the driver REFUSES TO START unless the
target clone's push is disabled. CRs are draft-only; nothing is published/merged.

The driver is fully target-agnostic: it sees the target only through the loaded
:class:`~.contracts.TargetProfile`. ``--dry-run`` exercises the whole pipeline with a
stub profile (mirrors ``autoloop.py --dry-run``).

    A rebase replays a commit onto a new parent, so the replay is a DIFFERENT object id

    A TREE BINDS LOCATION; A PATCH IDENTITY DOES NOT. ``git patch-id`` deliberately ignores
    hunk line numbers -- that is what lets it recognise a change replayed onto a moved base --

        The rebase retry DETACHES HEAD in order to replay the authorized object rather than

        """Push *src* to ``dest``, rebasing ONCE onto the remote if it moved meanwhile.

        *src* is the revision the FIRST push sends, and it is REQUIRED: an object id cannot be
        repointed, so once this is called, nothing running in the clone can change which commit
        gets published. Pushing the symbolic ``HEAD`` left a time-of-check/time-of-use window --
        the identity check happens, then the credential scan and the push each re-read ``HEAD``
        -- and a background process left behind by the pre-push reviewer could move it in
        between. Raised by the GPT review of this branch.

        It began as an optional parameter defaulting to ``HEAD`` "for callers that have nothing
        more specific". There were none: the sole production caller resolves the committed
        object first and passes it. That default kept three arms alive that fired only for a
        symbolic source -- skipping the pre-fetch tamper check, replaying the BRANCH rather than
        the object, and reading ``HEAD`` after the push for the ledger -- each of them the very
        check-then-use shape this change exists to remove. Requiring the argument deletes all
        three. Raised by the first-principles review of this branch, which asked for the
        subtraction rather than more guards.

        THE RETRY REPUBLISHES BY ID TOO. A rebase REPLAYS the commit as a NEW object, so *src*
        names the pre-rebase commit -- not what the rebase produced, and non-fast-forward
        anyway -- but the answer is to resolve the REPLACEMENT to a full id, credential-scan
        that object, and push it. An earlier revision of this method pushed ``HEAD`` there and
        justified it with "``_reverify_head`` has just run", which was the same
        check-then-use mistake this branch fixed twice elsewhere: the build gate is a check,
        the push is a later use, and ``HEAD`` is re-resolved in between. It also published an
        object no credential scan had ever covered, because the caller scans the PRE-rebase
        object. Raised by the GPT review of this branch.

        A run takes tens of minutes, so the branch can legitimately advance between the
        clone's fetch and the winner's push — and a bare push then dies
        ``! [rejected] ... (fetch first)``, stranding a fully verified fix. Measured on
        this app's own dogfood: 3 of 6 gate survivors were lost this way, every one of
        them work that had already passed RED x2 -> GREEN -> STAYGREEN.

        The retry is deliberately narrow and safe:
          * only on a NON-FAST-FORWARD rejection — any other failure (auth, no such
            ref, protected branch) is returned untouched, because retrying those just
            hides the real error;
          * ``git rebase`` REPLAYS our single verified commit on top of the new remote
            tip. A conflict aborts the rebase and returns the original failure rather
            than pushing a half-merged tree;
          * the REPLAYED tree is RE-VERIFIED through the profile's build gate before it
            is pushed (:meth:`_reverify_head`). A clean rebase is a statement about
            TEXT, not about behaviour: our verified patch combined with whatever landed
            on the branch meanwhile is a tree nothing has ever built or tested. Without
            this the retry published an unverified commit — the one thing the whole
            measurement-first pipeline exists to prevent. Raised by the GPT review of
            this branch;
          * never ``--force``. If the second push is also rejected, we stop — a losing
            race is a signal, not something to overwrite.

        The caller must record ``self._pushed_object``, which this sets to whatever it actually
        sent, and NOT its own pre-push snapshot: a rebase rewrites HEAD, so the pre-rebase sha
        names a commit that does not exist on the remote. Reading the sha back from the clone is

        """Is the clone's HEAD still the commit this pipeline committed? ``(ok, note)``.

        This gate holds one invariant: do not push what a worker did not commit.
        *committed_id* is the FULL object id of what :meth:`_finalize_winner_commit` /
        :meth:`_finalize_bug_winner_commit` produced -- the commit that was measured,
        reproduced and written to the ledger -- resolved by the caller BEFORE the review gate
        runs. Nothing holds the verified commit and the published one together, and the window
        between them is not empty: :meth:`_prepush_review_clean` runs an agent in THIS clone
        with ``Bash`` for up to 30 turns, and that runner's git denylist covers only ``push``
        and ``remote set-url``, so ``git commit --amend`` is permitted there. That prompt is
        report-only and grants no ``Edit``, but neither is an ENFORCEMENT BOUNDARY -- a prompt
        is an instruction to an agent that may be
        carrying an injected diff, and a shell can write files whatever the tool list says -- so
        a moved HEAD stays reachable and this check is what refuses it.

        THE ABBREVIATION IS NEVER RE-RESOLVED, and that is why the caller resolves early. Git
        resolves a revision through REF NAMES before abbreviated object ids, so re-resolving
        the finalizer's short sha here would be defeatable by the very actor this gate
        distrusts: amend, then ``git branch <old-short-sha> HEAD``, and both sides resolve to
        the amended HEAD. Comparing a retained full id against HEAD's own resolution has no
        such input. Raised by the GPT review of this branch.

        Resolved with ``rev-list -1`` rather than ``rev-parse --verify`` because this method
        ALREADY asks a different question with ``rev-parse --verify --quiet HEAD~1`` -- "does
        a parent exist", a boolean that picks the credential scan's range. One verb carrying
        two unrelated questions is indistinguishable to a reader and to any caller keyed on
        the argv, and ``test_ai_spine_driver_coverage``'s git double is keyed on exactly that:
        its own docstring says prefixes are scripted "so a caller can pin
        ``rev-parse --verify`` separately from ``rev-parse HEAD``". One prefix, one call site.

        FAIL-CLOSED. A revision that does not resolve is the ABSENCE of the check, not a
        pass: an amended-away commit can be pruned, and "I could not look" must never read
        as "I looked and it was fine".

        line: HEAD keeps the refused commit, the next winner commits on top of it, and that
        winner's single-revision scan cannot see the parent its own push would publish. So a
        failure latches ``_rollback_failed`` and stops the run, at this chokepoint rather than
        at the five call sites, because a caller that forgets to check is the whole defect.

        ONE COMMAND, and that is the whole point. ``git reset --hard`` acts on WHATEVER IS
        CHECKED OUT, and this runs after the pre-push reviewer has had a shell in the clone --
        whose denylist covers only ``push`` and ``remote set-url``, so ``git checkout`` is
        permitted there. Two ways that bites:

        * the reviewer checks out a DIFFERENT branch, and the rollback hard-resets that branch
          to a sha from an unrelated run, destroying its commits;
        * HEAD is DETACHED, and the reset moves the detachment while the branch keeps carrying
          the provisional commit -- a rollback that silently does not roll back.

        An earlier fix read ``rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD``, checked the branch out if it
        differed, then reset -- which was the same check-then-use pair one level up: a
        backgrounded ``setsid git checkout victim`` landing between the check and the reset put
        the reset back on the wrong branch. ``git checkout -f -B <branch> <pre_sha>`` is a
        single invocation that NAMES the branch, moves it to *pre_sha* and checks it out, so
        there is no window and no ambiguity about which ref moves. ``-f`` keeps the old
        ``reset --hard`` semantics of discarding the working tree. Fail closed on error: a
        provisional commit left behind is resolved by the next cycle's stage step, while

        THE GUARD HAS TO OUTLIVE THE PROCESS, because the thing it guards does. The in-memory
        latch stops this run, but the un-rolled-back commit is on DISK and the clone is REUSED:
        the next run starts with a clear latch on a clone that still carries the refused commit,
        commits the next winner on top of it, and publishes an ancestor its single-revision scan
        never looked at. A guard scoped to a process lifetime is checking something shorter-lived
        than the hazard. Raised by the GPT review of this branch; the conductor asked for
        quarantine over a persisted latch, because a persisted latch raises the question of when
        it clears and one that clears on the wrong event is worse than none.

        Retirement is the app's OWN primitive for exactly this, not a new mechanism:
        ``_retire_unsafe_clone`` renames the root directory aside, and its docstring already
        says it "prevents a later run from adopting a rejected provisional commit". Reuse in
        ``_setup_safe_clone`` hinges on the canonical ``<dest>/.git`` being a directory, so a
        retired clone is not reused -- the next run clones fresh. Nothing about how clones are
        located or named changes, and the bytes are preserved for diagnosis.

        Unconditional: unlike :meth:`_retire_if_unsafe`, this does not consult the isolation
        probe first. The trigger is the failed rollback itself, which is already known, so a
        probe verdict could only talk us out of quarantining a clone we know is poisoned.

        RETIREMENT ITSELF CAN FAIL, and the reason it fails is correlated with the reason the
        rollback failed rather than independent of it: a Windows process still holding handles
        inside the tree makes both the force-checkout and the rename fail from that one cause.
        Logging "MUST NOT be reused" is not a guard -- the next run does not read this log --
        so a marker is persisted at a masked crew-home leaf (``_mark_clone_quarantined``) and
        ``_setup_safe_clone`` refuses a marked clone. Reuse there attests git metadata and
        remotes and never inspects the branch tip, so without the marker the poisoned tree
        passes every existing check. The marker deliberately does NOT live beside the clone:
        the scratch tree is one the agent works in, so a marker there could be truncated
        through a pre-placed hardlink or simply deleted.

        THE MARKER IS WRITTEN FIRST, BEFORE THE RENAME IS ATTEMPTED. Ordering it after made
        the durable record depend on a path reached only once two things had already failed,
        and a transient failure of the marker write itself then left the clone reusable with
        nothing recording that it must not be -- fail-open at the exact moment the guard is
        needed. Written first, the record exists before anything is disturbed, and a rename
        that then SUCCEEDS makes it stale rather than wrong: the marker names a directory, so
        it stops reporting once that directory is gone and is pruned on the way past. A write
        that fails is now known BEFORE the tree is touched and is escalated as such. All three
        halves raised by the GPT review of this branch.
