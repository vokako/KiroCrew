"""Shared interpreter resolution for app spawn paths.

One policy, two consumers. The app BACKEND launcher (``backend.py``) and the
app stdio MCP SERVER registration (``bridges.py``) both spawn Python processes
on an app's behalf, and both must refuse to trust a bare ``python3``: a bare
name is resolved through PATH at spawn time, which is not guaranteed to exist
(some hosts ship only a versioned interpreter, so ``execvp("python3")`` raises
FileNotFoundError) and, even when present, may be an older system interpreter
than the one the app's dependencies were installed against — the process then
starts under the wrong interpreter and dies on import, with nothing surfaced
to the user.

The policy: once the gateway has provisioned the app's dependencies
(``pip install --target`` into :func:`app_deps_dir`, reaching the child via
``PYTHONPATH``), the gateway's own ``sys.executable`` is the only
ABI-consistent interpreter and is used unconditionally. An app that
DECLARES ``requirements.txt`` also pins ``sys.executable`` even when
provisioning has not (yet) succeeded: the deps will be provisioned for that
interpreter's ABI on a later start, and letting a shipped venv win in the
interim would flip the ABI out from under the eventual install. Only an app
with NO declared requirements prefers its OWN venv interpreter, when it
ships a version-matched one (a self-consistent environment the app author
built), else falls back to ``sys.executable`` (always an absolute path to a
real interpreter). The gateway itself does not create app venvs. Keeping the
policy in one place is the point - two divergent copies is exactly the
defect class this module removes.
