"""Launch shim for app processes with gateway-provisioned dependencies.

Usage (always via the gateway's own interpreter)::

    python -m kiro_crew.apps.deps_boot <deps_dir> <script.py> [args...]
    python -m kiro_crew.apps.deps_boot <deps_dir> -m <module> [args...]
    python -m kiro_crew.apps.deps_boot <deps_dir> -c <code> [args...]

Why this exists: provisioned dependencies are a ``pip install --target``
tree, and the naive transport - prepending the tree to ``PYTHONPATH`` -
never processes ``.pth`` files, because ``PYTHONPATH`` entries are not site
directories. Packages that ship a ``.pth`` (editable installs, namespace
shims, import hooks) then install "successfully" and crash at import time.
``site.addsitedir`` IS the .pth-processing registration, so the shim runs it
on the deps dir and only then hands control to the real entry point.

``addsitedir`` appends; the app's pinned requirements must win over the
gateway environment's own packages, so the newly added entries are moved to
the FRONT of ``sys.path`` (matching the precedence the PYTHONPATH transport
had). The shim adds no other behavior: argv is rewritten so the target sees
exactly the argv it would have seen launched directly.
