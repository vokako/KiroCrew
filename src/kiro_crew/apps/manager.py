# Built-in app registration
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Built-in apps are features baked into the KiroCrew dashboard that we
# surface in the App Store as "builtin" entries.  They use the host's
# React tree directly (no ESM bundle) and their page components resolve
# through ``BUILTIN_COMPONENT_REGISTRY`` in the frontend.  The registration
# here is metadata-only so the App Store can display them alongside
# installable apps.
#
# Default-disabled policy: a builtin app ships with ``defaultEnabled: False``
# so a fresh install presents a minimal sidebar (core surfaces only) instead of
# every app at once. Apps are opt-in from the App Store Browse tab. Because
# ``register_builtin_apps()`` applies ``defaultEnabled`` only on first
# registration and preserves user state on restart, existing users keep
# whatever they already enabled — this only changes the out-of-the-box
# experience for new installs.
#
# The exception is _DEFAULT_ON_BUILTINS below.

# Builtins deliberately shipped ENABLED on a fresh install, exempt from the
# opt-in policy above because they are core surfaces rather than optional
# add-ons. Adding a name here is a product decision, not a convenience — keep
# the set small. A default-on builtin still honors the ``apps`` governance
# allowlist at registration (see _app_activation_denied), so a deny-by-default
# host policy is never bypassed.
#
# This is the single source of truth for the exemption: the policy tests over
# both the hardcoded list and the file-based manifests read it from here, so a
# builtin cannot become default-on in one registration path while the other
# path's test still forbids it.
_DEFAULT_ON_BUILTINS: frozenset[str] = frozenset(
    {
        "projects",  # Task Runner
        # Command Bar replaces the quick-search (Cmd+K) surface rather than adding
        # a sidebar entry, so shipping it off leaves the gesture on the legacy
        # palette and the launcher unseen. Disabling the app is what restores the
        # old surface, which is the opt-out this exemption trades for.
        "command-bar",
    }
)

# Promotions still owed to installs that PREDATE them — a different question from
# the set above, and the distinction is load-bearing.
#
# ``_DEFAULT_ON_BUILTINS`` answers "what does a FRESH install enable". This set
# answers "which promotion has not yet reached installs that registered the app
# while it was still default-off". Reading the first set for the second question
# reverses deliberate opt-outs: ``projects`` (Task Runner) has shipped
# ``defaultEnabled: true`` since it was aligned with the other builtins, long
# before this allowlist existed, so it has been enabled and visible in the
# sidebar on every existing install. A record showing ``enabled: false`` for it
# is therefore a user who FOUND it and turned it off — the opposite of the
# population a backfill exists to serve.
#
# So a name belongs here only when both hold: a fresh install enables it (it is
# in the set above), and existing installs were never in a position to choose.
# ``command-bar`` qualifies because it was default-OFF at first registration for
# those installs AND, replacing the quick-search surface rather than adding a
# sidebar entry, it appears on no store or launcher surface they could have found
# it on. An app already default-on when they installed it never qualifies.
#
# Entries are permanent, not cleaned up after a release: the marker is per
# install, so a user restoring an old data home still gets the promotion once.
_DEFAULT_ON_BACKFILL: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"command-bar"})


def backfill_default_on_builtins() -> list[str]:
    """Deliver a default-on PROMOTION to installs that predate it. One-shot per app.

    ``register_builtin_apps()`` applies ``defaultEnabled`` only on FIRST
    registration and preserves user state on every later start, so adding a name
    to ``_DEFAULT_ON_BUILTINS`` reaches NEW installs only. An install that
    registered the app while it was still default-off keeps ``enabled: false``
    through every subsequent restart, update and version bump — the record lives
    in the user's data home, which a code update does not touch.

    That is survivable for a builtin that adds a sidebar entry, because the App
    Store can still offer it. It is not survivable for one that replaces a host
    surface: it has no page, so it is absent from the launcher's own app list,
    and it is absent from Discover unless the published catalog carries a row for
    it, which leaves a disabled row in Library as the only trace. Those users
    cannot enable what they have no way to learn exists.

    Reads ``_DEFAULT_ON_BACKFILL``, NOT ``_DEFAULT_ON_BUILTINS`` — see that set's
    comment for why conflating the two silently reverses deliberate opt-outs.

    ONE-SHOT, and the record of that is ``InstalledApp.defaultOnBackfilled``,
    written in the SAME atomic record write that flips ``enabled``. One document
    deliberately: a separate marker file has no correct ordering, because
    whichever of the two writes goes first leaves a window the other one owns.
    Marker-last loses the record of an enable that happened, so every later start
    re-applies the promotion and reverses the user's own disable forever;
    marker-first can outlive a flip that failed, so the app is skipped forever and
    the promotion is never delivered. Both are real; neither is reachable when the
    flag and the state it guards land or fail together.

    Surviving a user's disable is the point: disabling the app is the ONLY thing
    that gives a replaced host surface back. Per app rather than per install, so a
    promotion added in a later release is still delivered.

    Returns the names actually flipped, so the caller can log them.

# EMPTY, and that is a finished migration rather than an oversight. Every builtin now
# ships as a file-based manifest under ``builtins/<dir>/app.json`` and is picked up by
# ``discover_builtin_apps()``. ``agent-worlds`` and ``channels`` were the last two
# hardcoded entries; they moved to ``builtins/agent_worlds/app.json`` and
# ``builtins/channels/app.json`` with every field byte-identical, including the
# ``defaultEnabled: false`` / ``hidden: true`` flags, which survive because
# ``_manifest_to_builtin_dict`` copies ``AppManifest.extra`` verbatim.
#
# One thing JSON cannot carry came with them, so it is recorded here: ``channels`` sets
# ``hidden: true`` to keep itself out of the App Store Browse grid only. Its code and
# routes stay fully intact and it is enabled with ``kirocrew app enable channels``.
# ``hidden`` gates store visibility, nothing else.
#
# Why it had to happen for i18n: the display copy of a builtin is localised by the
# ``APP_MANIFEST_KEY`` table in ``website/src/components/appstore/appManifest.ts``, and
# ``scripts/check-app-manifest-sync.mjs`` proves the English catalog value still equals
# the manifest's own prose. A manifest that lives in a Python literal has no file for
# that check to read, so these two apps would have been the only builtins whose copy
# could drift silently.
#
# It stays a list rather than being deleted because it is still the ADD-only precedence
# seam: ``register_builtin_apps`` and ``detect_orphaned_builtins`` union it with the
# discovered and edition-contributed sets, so an edition (or a test) can inject a
# builtin that outranks a discovered one without reintroducing the hardcoding. Prefer a
# file manifest; reach for this only when there is no directory to put one in.
