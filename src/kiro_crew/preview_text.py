"""Markdown → plain-text stripping for one-line UI previews.

The sidebar/session-list preview (`last_message` in slot ``to_dict()`` and
``HistoryLog.last_message_preview``) is a single truncated line rendered as
plain text — raw markdown markers (``**bold**``, ``` ```diff `` fences, link
syntax) read as noise there. This helper strips markdown down to readable
plain text, Slack/Telegram-preview style, WITHOUT rendering it.

Deliberately gentler than ``voice_reply.strip_markdown`` (which optimizes for
speech): emoji are kept (though ZWJ-joined sequences decompose into their
constituent emoji, since Unicode format characters are dropped — see
``drop_format_chars``), inline code keeps its literal text, and single
underscores are left alone so ``snake_case`` identifiers survive intact.

    """Remove Unicode format characters (category Cf) from *text*.

    Cf covers the zero-width space/joiners, the word joiner, BOM, bidi
    controls and the soft hyphen: characters that render as nothing yet are
    truthy in string guards, and that ``str.split()`` does NOT treat as
    whitespace. Quiet monitor-loop cycles post a bare U+200B as their
    say-nothing assistant reply, so without this step a message of pure
    format characters survives the whitespace collapse as a truthy-but-
    invisible preview — defeating every empty-preview fallback downstream
    (the sidebar subtitle and archived-session previews both skip a row only
    when its preview is empty). Dropping the whole Cf category rather than an
    enumerated zero-width set closes the class, not one codepoint; the cost
    is that ZWJ-joined emoji sequences decompose into their constituent emoji
    in a one-line preview.

    This is the ONE implementation of the Cf drop:
    ``messaging.display_safety._strip_format_chars`` delegates here, and its
    docstring carries the security half of the contract — the drop can
    REASSEMBLE a credential that format characters had split, so callers must
    strip BEFORE running pattern-based redaction, never after. The ASCII fast
    path is sound, not an approximation: the ASCII range holds no Cf code
    point (the C0 controls are Cc), so ordinary traffic never pays for the
    per-character walk.
