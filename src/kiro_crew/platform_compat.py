#    use a generous ceiling that no real hold approaches, matching POSIX's "wait
#    for the lock" as closely as a bounded spin can.
#  - ON the loop (e.g. bridges._mcp_lock during app enable): a spin-sleep would
#    freeze chat/heartbeat, so that path never sleeps at all (single-shot).

    """Acquire an advisory lock on ``fd`` for the duration of the block.

    POSIX: ``fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX|LOCK_SH)`` with ``LOCK_UN`` release.
    Windows: ``msvcrt.locking`` on the first byte, acquired by spinning on the
    non-blocking code up to ``_WIN_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECS`` — because msvcrt's own
    "blocking" code gives up after ~10s with EDEADLOCK, which cannot be treated
    as a wait. ``msvcrt`` has no shared mode, so a shared request is satisfied
    with an exclusive lock (correctness over concurrency — readers genuinely
    serialize with the holder, but never see torn writes).

    On Windows the acquire is single-shot when called on the asyncio event-loop
    thread (a spin-sleep there would freeze chat/heartbeat) and a bounded poll
    up to the timeout otherwise; either way, if the lock cannot be taken
    ``file_lock`` FAILS CLOSED — it raises rather than entering the critical
    section unserialized, since proceeding lock-less is the exact fail-open that
    loses writes. The timeout is a safety ceiling against a stuck holder, not a
    normal wait (every in-tree critical section is a sub-second read + atomic
    rename). ``required`` is kept for call-site intent and does not change
    the outcome (both paths refuse to proceed without the lock). On POSIX the
    acquire blocks until the lock is free.

    *wait* is for a caller whose work is OPTIONAL and retried later, and which
    may run on the event-loop thread: with ``wait=False`` the acquire is
    single-shot on every platform and raises :class:`BlockingIOError` at once
    when the lock is held, instead of blocking the loop for as long as the holder
    keeps it. POSIX gets that from ``LOCK_NB``; Windows already behaves this way
    on the loop thread, and a zero timeout makes it uniform off the loop too.
    ``BlockingIOError`` is an ``OSError``, so it is a NARROWING of what a caller
    already had to handle, and it separates "someone else is writing right now"
    from the stuck-holder ceiling above. It changes only how long we are willing
    to wait, never whether the critical section is serialized -- a contended
    ``wait=False`` acquire raises rather than proceeding.

    Note: on Windows, ``msvcrt.locking`` requires seeking to byte 0, so the
    ``fd`` must be a dedicated lock file; callers must not rely on the file
    offset being preserved across the context manager boundary.

    (unlink and recreate, or rename the parent aside), so an agent could publish a
    read-only file of its own choosing and pass a leaf-only check.

    Walks upward to the root and stops at the first writable component, so the answer is
    "there exists a way in" rather than "the leaf looks fine". Two chains are walked, the path

    callers rely on to reach their warn-and-continue handlers.

    Windows: strip inheritance and apply an owner-only DACL in-process via

    ask :func:`windows_acl.volume_is_local` FIRST and skip the lockdown itself.
    That decision is deliberately not a parameter here: by the time this function
    is reached the caller has already done whatever filesystem work it took to get

    difference between the two is whether the grants are inheritable, so they are
    one function: an owner-only DACL that two call paths could drift apart on is
    the defect this consolidation exists to prevent.

    The descriptor is built through ``advapi32`` directly rather than by shelling
    out to ``icacls /inheritance:r /grant:r ...``, so no "must not run on the
    event loop" constraint falls on the callers: measured on a local NTFS
    volume, the subprocess costs 313 ms per call and this costs 0.24 ms. Callers
    that already offload it are still free to -- a filesystem call can block on
    a slow volume, so offloading remains good practice -- but it is not
    mandatory, and a caller on the loop does not park the gateway for a third of

    shelling out.

    If the SID cannot be resolved we CANNOT safely apply the DACL: an
    Owner-Rights-only descriptor (S-1-3-4 alone) would lock the current user out
    of their own file whenever the file was created by a different principal

    preserving foreign ownership -- the exact scenarios the dual grant exists to

    on a host whose token read fails we refuse rather than spawning
    ``whoami``. That is the safe direction -- a caller that must not fail passes

# raises ``OSError`` and each reading degrades to its own sentinel.
#
# NOT the only way this repository walks a process tree, and deliberately so.
# ``session_pid._build_child_map`` sums a session's tree from a full ``/proc``
# scan of every process's ``stat`` ``PPid`` field, precisely because the
# ``children`` file this walk reads needs ``CONFIG_PROC_CHILDREN`` and is
# documented as reliable only for frozen tasks -- for a live task it can return
# an incomplete child set and silently drop a descendant subtree from the sum.
# That trade is the right one there (an under-counted tree would make the RSS
# watchdog no-op) and the wrong one here: these two callers sample per backend
# and per live agent on a timer, where a whole-machine scan per sample is the
# larger cost, and an under-count degrades a displayed number rather than

# behaviour change to figures users already read, not part of this

    makes "the same set of processes" true of the *result* and not merely of the

def apply_job_limits(pid: int, *, max_procs: int, max_memory_bytes: int) -> bool:
    """Bound *pid* and its descendants with a Windows Job object.

    The Windows analogue of ``sandbox.cgroup_scope_argv``:

    ==============================  ====================================
    cgroup v2                       Job object
    ==============================  ====================================
    ``TasksMax`` (fork bomb)        ``ActiveProcessLimit``
    ``MemoryMax`` (RSS balloon)     ``JobMemoryLimit``
    ==============================  ====================================

    The memory row is a true equivalent; the process row is NOT one-for-one.
    ``TasksMax`` counts tasks — every thread — while ``ActiveProcessLimit``
    counts processes, so the same numeric budget is a LOOSER bound here: a
    tree of N processes holds at least N tasks and usually many more. It still
    bounds a fork bomb, which is the control's purpose, but do not read the two
    limits as equal strictness, and do not "fix" the gap by scaling the number
    without deciding what a process budget should be — the units differ, so
    there is no arithmetic conversion between them.

    Enforcement is by DENIAL, matching the cgroup tier's practical behavior:
    once ``ActiveProcessLimit`` is reached the member's ``CreateProcess`` calls
    fail with ``ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_QUOTA``, and an allocation past
    ``JobMemoryLimit`` fails, rather than the tree being killed outright.
    Nothing about process lifetime changes (see the ``KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`` note
    above).

    Returns ``True`` when the limits were applied. Returns ``False`` — never
    raises — on POSIX (where ``cgroup_scope_argv`` owns this), on a non-positive
    limit, or on any Win32 failure; the caller treats that as "no ceiling
    enforced" exactly as it already treats the cgroup probe failing.

    Race-free ONLY when paired with :data:`CREATE_SUSPENDED`. Job membership
    covers a member's FUTURE descendants but not ones it already spawned, so
    assigning a *running* child leaves a window in which it could have forked
    something that escapes the job. Callers therefore create the child with
    ``creationflags |= CREATE_SUSPENDED`` — a suspended process has executed no
    instructions and so provably has no descendants — call this, then
    :func:`resume_process_main_thread`. That closes the window by construction
    rather than merely making it small. This function still works on an
    already-running pid (the ceiling then applies from that moment on); the
    suspended handshake is what makes it airtight.

    :func:`apply_job_limits` can put it in a job knowing no descendant escaped;
    this then lets it run.

    kernel32 has no ``ResumeProcess``, so the main thread has to be reached by
    ID: snapshot the system thread list
    (``CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPTHREAD)``), select entries whose
    ``th32OwnerProcessID`` matches, and ``ResumeThread`` each. A freshly created
    suspended process has exactly one thread, but every match is resumed rather
    than only the first — resuming a thread that is not suspended is a harmless
    no-op (its suspend count is already 0), whereas guessing wrong about which
    thread is "main" would leave the process wedged forever.
