        identity ones: whether the skill opted out of full-body injection, how
        big its body is, and how many times that body was actually DELIVERED into
        a prompt. Cost is the product of the last two, and a user deciding
        whether to opt a skill out cannot weigh it without both.

        ``deliveries`` counts body deliveries, not trigger matches: the ledger
        records only when a body reaches the prompt, so a false-positive match, a
        pointer-only skill, and an undelivered match all count zero. Two
        consequences a caller must not paper over — a skill already opted out
        stops accruing entirely, so its figure is historical and frozen; and this
        is therefore a measure of what was SPENT, never of how often the skill
        was relevant.

        ``deliveries`` is ``None`` when the skill has no ledger entry, which is
        different from zero: an entry can also age out of the 30-day window.

        ``owned`` says whether Kiro Crew may rewrite the file. A skill reached
        through ``skills.extra_paths`` is listed but not ours to edit, so the UI
        must not offer a toggle the endpoint will refuse.

        This runs on the event loop as part of context assembly (the skill
        index). Unconfined rows take exactly one stat and reuse its mtime for

        Split out so the rollback has one exit rather than being threaded through

        leftover directory makes ``create_skill``'s ``exists()`` guard answer False
        forever, so every retry is a 409 over a truncated body that ``list_skills()``
        still serves. Steering's create already unlinks its partial leaf for exactly
        that reason; this is the same rule, plus the directory, because this call is
        the one that created it.

        A skill carrying ``repo_scope: <relpath>`` is only eligible for

        — e.g. ``repo_scope: src/kiro_crew`` restricts a skill to sessions

        loader-enforced counterpart to a prose "ignore this skill elsewhere"
        scope guard: prose depends on probabilistic LLM obedience, while this
        check runs before the skill ever reaches the context (destructive
        repo-dev instructions must be mechanically contained).

        *project_dir* is the SESSION's active project — the same value the

        deliberately NOT consulted: this runs in the gateway while it assembles

        started from inside a checkout of the scoped repo admitted the skill
        into EVERY session, while a packaged install whose cwd holds no marker
        suppressed it for every session, contributors included.

        Fails CLOSED — no project, an unusable one, or any error suppresses the
        skill, so an un-scoped surface never inherits repo-specific rules.

        The rule itself lives in ``kiro_crew.project_scope`` because lessons are
