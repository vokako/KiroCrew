"""Re-export shim: the tool-gate routing verdict now lives behind the agent-SDK boundary.

The implementation moved to :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.tool_gate` in RFC PR 3,
alongside the backend registry it reads. Read that module for what a verdict means
and what it does NOT guarantee; this file exists so ``acp/client.py`` and the
tests that monkeypatch this module needed no edit in the same commit as the move.

**Re-export, never a copy**, and one consequence is worth naming: ``acp/client.py``
imports this module and calls through it by attribute
(``acp_tool_gate.enforce_sandbox_floor(...)``), so a test that patches an attribute
HERE still changes what the client calls. Patching a name on
``agent_sdk.tool_gate`` instead reaches the internal callers too. Both work; they
are not the same reach.

The four names re-exported from ``agent_sdk.backends`` (``Routing``,
``routing_for``, ``permission_config_for``, ``ACP_BACKEND_CODEX``) were reachable
through the old module as well, because it imported them into its own namespace.
They stay reachable, so a caller reading ``acp_tool_gate.permission_config_for``
keeps working -- ``acp/client.py`` is one.
