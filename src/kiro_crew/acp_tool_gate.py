"""Whether a harness's tool decisions reach Kiro Crew's PreToolUse gate.

One place resolves the verdict, so the refusal message, the doctor row and any
future dashboard surface cannot disagree about why a session was allowed.

The gate itself -- the bundled denied-command rules, the sensitive-path block,
the governance ceiling -- runs only from ``HookManager.on_tool_call``, reached
only from the permission-request branch of the dispatch parser. A harness that
does not send ``session/request_permission`` per tool call is a harness where
none of those controls execute, so "does it ask?" is a security question rather
than a compatibility one.

**A LEAF module, deliberately.** It imports the vocabulary from
:mod:`kiro_crew.acp_backends` and nothing from ``kiro_crew.acp``, which the SDK
boundary gate treats as a forbidden root. The callers that need a verdict --
``acp/client.py`` on the session path, and later ``kirocrew doctor`` and the
dashboard -- can therefore all reach it, and a consumer naming a verdict does not
buy a forbidden edge to do it.

**Enforcement scope.** Only :data:`~kiro_crew.acp_backends.Routing.SESSION_CONFIG`
is ENFORCED here today, because it is the only mechanism this core implements end
to end. ``AGENT_SPEC`` needs no enforcement (it holds by construction), and
``SEEDED_SETTINGS`` is declared-but-unenforced, and the reason is a read-back
gap rather than a missing writer. ``AcpClient._write_claude_local_settings`` does
seed ``permissions.defaultMode`` into ``<work_dir>/.claude/settings.local.json``,
but it writes only the file it OWNS -- created this session and still carrying the
bytes Crew wrote -- and declines otherwise, and nothing reads back whether the
adapter honoured the mode. A ``bypassPermissions`` already sitting in a user's own
``settings.local.json`` or ``~/.claude`` is therefore neither detected nor
stripped, so the precondition this mechanism would need is not established.
``routing_verdict`` reports that honestly as INDETERMINATE -- what is scoped is
whether a non-ROUTED verdict REFUSES, not whether it is told truthfully. Widening the scope
means implementing a mechanism, not editing an allowlist.

    DERIVED from ``security.sensitive_home_dirs()`` rather than enumerated, and
    that is the whole point. This mask is the compensating control for a harness
    whose passive reads never reach ``HookManager.on_tool_call``: the floor states
    what an agent may never read, so anything on it the child can still open is a
    hole in the compensation. An enumerated short list left exactly that hole --
    ``.claude/.credentials.json``, ``.netrc``, ``.git-credentials``, ``.pypirc``
    and ``.npmrc`` were all on the floor and still readable by the child, the first
    of them a leaf this very change had just classified. Deriving keeps the two in
    step, and a floor entry added later is covered with no edit here.

    The harness's own credential store is excluded, because the adapter must read
    it to authenticate. That asymmetry is intentional and safe: the floor still
    blocks the AGENT's file tools from that leaf, so the two controls cover
    different readers rather than cancelling each other.

    ``.ssh`` arrives through the floor and it has a cost: git-over-SSH inside such
    a session stops working, because the private key is no longer readable. That
    is accepted rather than worked around -- leaving private keys readable would
    not close what this exists to close, and a harness landing new has no
    established workflow to break.

    Empty for a harness this core does not enforce, so the first-class path and
    every unenforced harness keep byte-identical sandbox arguments. Returns
    ABSOLUTE paths: ``sandbox.wrap_argv`` runs ``os.path.abspath`` over what it is
    handed, which would resolve a bare ``.aws`` against the CWD and silently deny
    nothing. File leaves are fine to pass -- the Linux launcher classifies each
    entry with its own ``isfile``/``isdir``, and the macOS profile emits both a
    ``subpath`` and a ``literal`` deny for each one, so a plain file is covered
    without depending on how Seatbelt treats a subpath over a non-directory.
