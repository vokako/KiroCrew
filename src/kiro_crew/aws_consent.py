"""Explicit operator consent before Kiro Crew spends money in an AWS account.

Two optional features reach a PAID AWS service through the provider's own
credential chain: Amazon Polly (text-to-speech, :mod:`kiro_crew.voice_reply`)
and Amazon Transcribe (speech-to-text, :mod:`kiro_crew.transcribe` and
:mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.stt_stream`). Both omit ``--profile`` / pass no
credential resolver when no profile is configured, so "no profile set" does not
mean "no account" -- it means "whichever account the ambient environment
resolves to", which can be one the operator never intended to bill.

Selecting the provider IS the consent point, not the first request
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The first request cannot be the confirmation point in practice. Polly synthesis
is triggered from surfaces with nobody watching: ``voice_reply`` fires from a
Slack thread reply and from ``auto_reply_to_voice`` (a voice memo arrives, a
spoken reply goes back), and a scheduled job can drive either. A blocking
prompt there has no one to answer it, and "no confirmation available means no
request" would then silently disable the feature rather than protect anyone.

So the gate is at CONFIGURATION time: turning a paid provider on is what asks,
and the answer is durable. What this module enforces at the call site is a
cheap LOCAL check that issues no AWS request of its own -- which matters,
because an identity probe before every synthesis would itself be exactly the
unwanted traffic the operator is trying to avoid.

Where the grant lives, and why not ``config.json``
--------------------------------------------------
``aws_service_consent.json`` sits on the read+write KEYSTONE floor
(``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES``), the same placement as ``computer_use.json``
and ``ops_mission_control_policy.json``, and for the same reason: this is an
authorization record, not a preference. ``config.json`` is writable by any
auto-approved agent shell, so a grant stored there could be minted by a
prompt-injected agent -- consenting, on the operator's behalf, to spending the
operator's money. The authenticated dashboard handler opens the path directly and
is the only writer. There is deliberately no CLI verb: a terminal command that
records a grant on request is a grant an automated caller can take, and its guard
would have to key on an env var an in-process agent can unset.

Known limit, stated rather than papered over
--------------------------------------------
A grant is keyed on ``(service, profile, region)`` and records the account id
that was confirmed. A profile NAME is not an account -- ``aws configure set
credential_process ... --profile <name>`` repoints an existing profile without
touching the credential files -- so the live account is re-checked on every
gated call, bounded by a short probe cache, and a mismatch refuses the call and
revokes the grant.

What that does NOT cover: the check needs a probe that can run. When the account
cannot be resolved the call is refused rather than allowed, so the failure mode
is a withheld paid call during an outage, not an unconfirmed charge. And
``aws configure set`` itself remains available to an agent shell, so this
contains the consequence rather than removing the cause.
