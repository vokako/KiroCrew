# Untrusted text mixed into the prompt — memory / lessons / history / episodic /

# an ASCII hyphen first) — and deliberately do NOT try to match the variable
# tail up to the closing ``]``. This (1) catches real / spaced / mixed-case /

# rules, agent/runtime identity, workspace identity, docs pointer, date). With
# this, the final hard truncation fires only if a section overflows its OWN cap
# (the per-section caps already prevent that), so sections never truncate each
# other. Works out to ~1.155 x base ≈ 190k chars (~63k tokens) — a larger

# ── Dynamic budget scaling (per active model context window) ─────────────────
# The module-level caps above are the FROZEN 1M-reference values — the base was
# hand-tuned for a 1M-token window, so every section's percentage of that window
# is fixed. When a session runs on a SMALLER-window model (e.g. Opus 4.8 200K),
# injecting the same absolute char counts would consume ~5x the proportional
# share of the window and accelerate compaction. So we scale the base linearly
# with the active window — ``base(window) = _CONTEXT_BUDGET_BASE * window /
# _REFERENCE_WINDOW_TOKENS`` — which keeps each section's SHARE OF THE WINDOW
# identical across models (a section that is 20% of a 1M window stays 20% of a
# 200K window, i.e. one-fifth the chars). At the reference window the scale
# factor is exactly 1.0, so the default deployment is byte-for-byte unchanged.
_REFERENCE_WINDOW_TOKENS = 1_000_000

# Floor so a pathologically small (or misreported) window can't collapse the
# caps to ~0 and inject a degenerate/empty context. 20% of the base ≈ the 200K
# tier, our smallest real model window — below that, memory stops being useful
# before the model even runs, so clamp rather than shrink further.

#: Shape a ``dashboard.language`` value must have before it is injected into the

#: handler's ``_LANGUAGE_TAG_RE`` (context.py must not depend on the aiohttp
#: handler layer), and deliberately a superset-safe one: every tag that
#: validator accepts matches this, so the two cannot disagree about a legitimate
#: value. It exists because the writer's validation is not the only way a value
#: reaches this field — the config loader coerces whatever JSON holds into
#: ``str``, so a hand-edited ``"language": null`` arrives as the literal
#: ``"None"`` and ``["zh-CN"]`` as ``"['zh-CN']"``. Anything that is not
#: tag-shaped is dropped rather than pasted into the system prompt.

#: The language catalogs the dashboard actually ships — a mirror of the
#: non-dev-only entries in ``website/src/i18n/languages.ts``
#: (``SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES``), which stays the single source of truth:
#: ``test_context_ui_language.py`` parses that file and fails when this set
#: drifts, so adding a language remains a frontend data change plus the one
#: mechanical entry here that the drift test names explicitly.
#:
#: Membership is exact and case-sensitive because that is precisely how the
#: frontend restores a PERSISTED choice: ``resolveLanguage()`` accepts a stored
#: value only via ``isRestorableLanguage()`` → ``SUPPORTED_CODES.includes()``
#: (no lowering, no primary-subtag fallback — those apply only to *browser*
#: detection tags, which never reach this field). A stored ``zh-cn`` or
#: ``zh-TW`` therefore degrades to auto-detect in the SPA, and the backend must
#: reach the same verdict or the two disagree about the active language —
#: which is exactly the bug this set exists to prevent (#1130).
#:
#: The dev-only ``en-XA`` pseudolocale is deliberately ABSENT: in a production
#: build ``isRestorableLanguage()`` refuses to restore it (the chrome degrades
#: to auto-detect), and even in a dev build steering a model to write
#: pseudolocale prose is meaningless — the accent-and-bracket transform is
#: generated, not a language a model can write. Treating it as non-catalog
#: keeps injection behaviour identical across build modes.

    Public because the UI language now steers more than the session-context block
    below: the dashboard's auto-titler asks a background model for a session name
    that renders in the sidebar, so it needs the same tag resolved the same way.
    One resolver keeps the two from disagreeing about what counts as a usable
    value (see ``_UI_LANGUAGE_TAG_RE`` for why the shape is re-checked here even
    though the writer validates it).

    Beyond shape, the tag must name a catalog the dashboard actually ships
    (``_UI_LANGUAGE_CATALOGS``). A shape-valid tag with no catalog — e.g. a
    persisted ``ar``, or a language later removed from the frontend registry —
    renders the chrome in English (the SPA falls back to detection), so steering
    the agent to it would put tool-call purpose pills, and the Slack/Discord task
    titles derived from them, in a language the UI around them cannot render.
    Those purposes persist in session history and are inherited by forked
    sessions, so the mismatch is durable. A non-catalog tag therefore takes the
    identical path to ``""``: inject nothing, and the model mirrors the
    conversation instead (#1130).

    ``""`` means "the backend does not know" — nothing was chosen (the
    "follow the browser" sentinel, resolved in the SPA's ``resolveLanguage()``),
    the stored value is not tag-shaped, or it names no shipped catalog. Callers
    must treat it as unknown rather than as English. A caller that CAN learn an
    unconfigured browser's resolved language (a request-scoped hint) validates it
    through the same :func:`normalize_ui_language_tag` gate this delegates to,
    so config and hint can never disagree about what counts as usable.

    Tool-call purpose text (``__tool_use_purpose``) is the one piece of

    the dashboard shows it as the tool-call pill label, and the messaging
    renderers (Slack/Discord/Telegram/...) reuse it as the task title. Every
    string around it — "Show details", button labels, timestamps — is driven by
    the UI language, so a purpose written in the conversation's language mixes
    two languages on one line, and does so *durably*: purposes are persisted in
    session history.

    Without this block the model has no idea what the UI language is and simply
    mirrors whatever language the user typed in — an inferred signal that flips
    the moment the user pastes an English stack trace. An explicit preference
    should win over inference, so we hand the model the configured tag.

    Returns "" when ``dashboard.language`` is empty, which is the "follow the

    and the backend genuinely does not know the answer, so there is nothing
    truthful to inject. Installs that never picked a language therefore see
    byte-identical context.

    The raw BCP-47 tag is injected rather than a display name on purpose: the
    frontend's ``SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`` registry is documented as the single
    source of truth where adding a language is a pure data change, and a
    code→name table here would be a second list to keep in sync (and would
    silently degrade to the tag for anything missing from it anyway).

    Raw does not mean unchecked: the value is dropped unless it is genuinely a
    ``str``, tag-shaped (``_UI_LANGUAGE_TAG_RE``), and names a shipped catalog
    (``_UI_LANGUAGE_CATALOGS``), so neither a malformed
    config nor a stubbed one can paste arbitrary text into the system prompt or

   the result back with the answer; for irreversible actions, come back with a
   concrete proposal and wait for approval. Never hand the problem back
   untouched.
2. Front desk vs workshop. This DM thread is your front desk — keep it light,
   because it lives for years. Do NOT run substantial work inline here: open a
   separate work session for it (spawn_run and the session tools), keep the
   heavy context there, and report back in this thread with the outcome and
   evidence ("re: <the thing>"). Several work items can run in parallel.
3. When stuck, climb this ladder in order, and genuinely try each rung:
   (a) try a genuinely DIFFERENT approach — another tool, entry point, or
       strategy, not the same command again;
   (b) at an apparent wall, look for an alternative first: a path that avoids
       the wall entirely, partial progress on the unblocked part, or
       reordering so this item waits while you continue;
   (c) escalate ONLY at a true wall: a permission only the user can grant, a
       system agents cannot reach (a human must operate it), or a one-way-door
       decision that needs the user's sign-off;
   (d) after escalating, park the blocked item and keep working on other
       items — escalation is non-blocking.
4. Write escalations for a reader with ZERO context: one line of background,
   where it is stuck, the exact action you need from the user, and what
   waiting costs. Keep it short. Before sending, have a context-free subagent

        Injected once at session start, not on every message.

        When *compressed_history* is provided, it replaces the naive
        truncation of thread history.  Callers obtain it by awaiting
        ``compress_thread_history()`` before calling this method.

        *model_window* is the active model's context window in tokens; every
        section cap is scaled proportionally to it (see ``_resolve_caps``) so a
        section keeps the SAME share of the window on a 200K model as on a 1M
        model. ``None``/unset falls back to the 1M reference (the default
        deployment's effective window), leaving that path byte-for-byte
        unchanged.

        All providers — including Claude Code — receive the
        same injected context (critical rules, thread history, memory, skills,
        lessons); steering files are the one exception (see below). This keeps
        Claude Code at parity with kiro so dashboard/Slack UI contracts (diff
        blocks, OPTIONS buttons, file links) and prior conversation context
        behave identically across providers.

        *provider_type* is consumed again for the steering gate only: the
        steering block below is injected solely on the CC backend
        (``is_claude_code(provider_type)``). kiro-cli loads an agent's
        ``resources`` natively when spawned with ``--agent`` (acp/client.py
        ``_spawn``), so re-injecting steering on the ACP/kiro backend would
        duplicate what kiro already loaded; the CC backend (claude-agent-acp)
        does NOT read agent ``resources`` and still needs the explicit load.
        Everything else stays at CC/ACP parity.

        *context_groups* selects which switchable groups are injected (see
        ``SWITCHABLE_CONTEXT_GROUPS``). ``None`` — every caller except a
        sub-agent whose parent opted a group out — injects all of them, so the
        output is unchanged. Omitting a group skips its sections entirely rather
        than capping them to zero: a zero cap yields a truncation marker, not an
        empty string. A sub-agent that had a group withheld is told so by name
        (``_build_context_scope_section``) so it reports the gap instead of
        guessing.

        For custom agents (non-kirocrew), skills and workspace identity are
        skipped — the agent loads its own prompt via kiro-cli. The dashboard
        critical-rules contract is injected by DEFAULT for every agent, but a
        custom agent can opt out of it (and the dashboard tool nudges) by setting
        ``includeCrewContext: false`` in its materialized JSON. Memory, lessons,
        and hooks are injected for all agents.

        Pass *compressed_history* (from ``compress_thread_history()``) to

        user slice remains the final prompt bytes.

        Pass *user_text_range* — the ``(start, end)`` bounds of the user's own
        typed text within *text* — to have the EXACT bounds of that text in the
        returned message written into *user_span_out* as ``[start, end]``. This
