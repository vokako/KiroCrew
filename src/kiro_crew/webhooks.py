"""Inbound-webhook support: token store, run history ring, context freshness.

Three concerns live here, all of them shared between the ``POST
/api/hooks/agent`` execution path and the dashboard's ``/api/webhooks``
management endpoints:

* :class:`WebhookTokenStore` — multiple named bearer tokens persisted as
  sha256 hashes only. The raw secret is returned exactly once, by
  :meth:`WebhookTokenStore.create`, and is unrecoverable afterwards.
* :func:`verify_signature` / :func:`sign_payload` — HMAC-SHA256 request
  signing over ``f"{timestamp}.{raw_body}"``, with a ±:data:`SIGNATURE_WINDOW_SECONDS`
  replay window and a bounded seen-signature set.
* :class:`WebhookRunStore` — a bounded ring of the last
  :data:`MAX_RUNS` webhook runs (including rejections and auth failures)
  so the UI can show real history instead of guessing.
* :func:`context_freshness` / :func:`resolve_context` — the single
  implementation of the three-horizon context decay. The dashboard badge
  and the actual injection both call it, so the badge can never claim
  "fresh" for context the agent would not receive.

Both stores use the same on-disk discipline as ``register_hook``:
read-modify-write under an advisory ``flock`` on a sidecar ``.lock`` file,
then an atomic ``os.replace`` of a 0600 temp file.

SECRET AT REST — ``webhook_tokens.json`` is not hash-only. Bearer tokens
are still stored as sha256 digests and cannot be recovered from the file, but
each entry's ``signing_secret`` is a LIVE secret held in plaintext: an HMAC is
symmetric, so the verifier has to be able to recompute it. That is an accepted
tradeoff of offering request signing at all, not an oversight. Consequences:
the file stays mode 0600, ``public_entries()`` strips ``signing_secret`` exactly
as it strips ``token_hash``, and anything that serialises a stored entry onto a
response must go through ``public_entries()`` or strip the key itself.
