#: transcript windows. A metadata entry is one parsed first line — title, agent,
#: created_at, tab_id, folder_id — measured in hundreds of bytes, so 256 buys
#: almost nothing in RAM terms and costs a great deal in I/O: ``list_sessions``
#: scans the WHOLE session directory in one cyclic pass, so an LRU smaller than
#: the corpus is evicted in exactly the order it will next be read and its hit
#: rate collapses to ~0. Measured on an 810-session store: a warm
#: ``list_sessions`` re-opened and re-parsed ~554 first lines on every call
#: (57.9 ms); with the cache able to hold the corpus the same call costs 24.5 ms,
#: all of it the unavoidable ``glob`` + one ``stat`` per file.
#:
#: This is the same failure mode ``_SearchTextCache`` already documents and
#: fixes — an LRU collapsing to a zero hit rate against the cyclic scan order —
#: applied to the memo every sidebar page fetch depends on. Still bounded, so a

    """A tiny bounded LRU cache with a dict-compatible surface.

    Backed by an :class:`collections.OrderedDict`; the most recently
    accessed key is kept at the end and eviction pops from the front
    (least-recently-used), so eviction order is fully deterministic for a
    given access sequence. Supports the subset of the mapping protocol the
    caller relies on (``get`` / ``__getitem__`` / ``__setitem__`` / ``pop`` /
    ``__contains__`` / ``__len__`` / ``clear``). Both reads (``get`` /
    ``__getitem__``) and writes mark a key as recently used.

    ``maxsize <= 0`` disables bounding (behaves like an ordinary dict) so a
    caller can opt out without a code-path split.

    Thread safety: the same :class:`ConversationLog` instance is touched from
    the event loop *and* from worker threads (``chat_persistence`` flush /
    restore, ``chat_regenerate`` / ``chat_rewind`` via ``asyncio.to_thread``,
    ``handlers/cron`` and ``slack/gateway`` off-loop ``read_messages`` calls).
    Every method therefore takes ``self._lock`` so each is atomic and the
    compound read-modify-write sequences (``move_to_end`` + index in ``get`` /
    ``__getitem__``; the eviction ``len()`` + ``popitem`` loop in
    ``__setitem__``) cannot interleave with a concurrent ``pop`` / ``clear``.
    Without it a concurrent ``pop`` landing in the bytecode gap between a
    successful ``move_to_end`` and the following index raised ``KeyError``
    (crashing the request/background task) instead of returning the default.
    The operations are tiny in-memory dict ops, so lock contention is
    negligible. A plain :class:`threading.Lock` suffices -- no method calls
    another locked method, so the lock is never re-entered.

    """Byte-budgeted memo for the two derived corpora ``search_sessions`` needs.

    Distinct from :class:`_LRUCache` because the access pattern is different in
    the one way that decides an eviction policy. A search walks its bounded
    session window **in the same recency order every query**, so the working set
    is cyclic. Under LRU a cyclic scan larger than the cache evicts each entry
    exactly one step before its next read: the hit rate does not degrade, it
    collapses to zero, and it does so for the users with the most sessions --
    the ones the memo exists for.

    An entry *count* is the wrong bound to carry that guarantee, because a
    session can approach the transcript byte ceiling. The bound here is
    therefore **bytes**, which is what actually has to fit in the gateway's RSS.

    A byte budget reintroduces the cliff, so eviction is replaced by
    **admission control**: when a new entry would exceed the budget it is simply
    not stored, and the entries already held are kept. For a cyclic scan that
    turns 0% into (whatever fraction fits)% -- and because ``search_sessions``
    walks most-recent-first, the fraction that stays cached is the most recently
    active sessions, which is the half worth keeping. Existing entries are still
    replaced in place on a content change (same key, new value), so a session
    that is being written to never gets stuck on a stale value.

    ``max_bytes <= 0`` disables the bound (behaves like a plain dict).
