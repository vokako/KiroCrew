"""Shared hardened runner for the GitHub CLI (``gh``).

Single source of the gh TRUST POLICY — binary validation, resolution order,
and the child-environment key set — for every ``gh``-spawning surface: the
dashboard's PR sidebar (``dashboard/handlers/source_providers.py``), Issue
Radar (``apps/builtins/issue_radar/backend/github_client.py``), and Code
Review Sage (``apps/builtins/code_review_sage/sage_lib/discovery.py`` /
``pipeline.py``). Each previously carried its own copy of the hardened-runner
pattern, so a hardening fix had to land in three places and a missed copy
silently kept the weaker guard.

Spawning is shared for the sync app-side callers only: Issue Radar and Sage
route every spawn through :func:`run_gh` below, while the sidebar keeps its
own async, sandbox-routed, output-bounded spawn (``_run_json``) and consumes
only this module's validation/candidates/env-key policy. A spawn-level
hardening change must therefore land in ``run_gh`` AND ``_run_json`` — two
places, down from four, with the policy itself in one.

The shared pieces:

* **Trusted-binary resolution** — :func:`validate_provider_executable` and
  :func:`provider_executable_candidates` (the policy that refuses a binary
  owned by another user, a world-writable one, or one inside the
  agent-writable project/workspace tree), plus :func:`resolve_gh`, the
  caller-facing resolver with override-env and caching semantics.
* **Minimal child environment** — :func:`gh_env`, the one canonical
  passthrough list of gh-scoped auth/network/TLS variables on top of the
  platform's safe-key base. Ambient SSH-agent/git-ssh identity is stripped:
  ``gh api`` authenticates with its own token/config over HTTPS and has no
  business presenting the gateway's ssh identity.
* **The sync spawn chokepoint** — :func:`run_gh`, which enforces a validated
  absolute binary, the minimal env, a bounded timeout, and a SEL audit event
  on success, failure, and timeout for every sync app-side caller.
* **URL parsing** — :func:`parse_github_repo_url` and :class:`RepoUrlError`.

This module MUST NOT import ``kiro_crew.dashboard.*`` (at module scope or
lazily): it exists to dissolve that cross-layer dependency. Heavy runtime deps
(``kiro_crew.sel``, ``kiro_crew.apps.registry``, ``kiro_crew.config.loader``)
are imported lazily inside functions so Code Review Sage's standalone import
path (``sage_lib`` without the Kiro Crew runtime) keeps working for callers
that guard their import of this module.

    Resolution inside a directory is delegated to :func:`shutil.which`, which

    `.\\gh.exe`. Since the gateway's CWD is not something this module controls,
    the containment check is what makes delegating to ``which`` safe.

    The containment test uses ``abspath``, deliberately not ``resolve``: the
