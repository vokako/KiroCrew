"""Which ACP backends this build can serve — the one place that decides.

The question this module owns is **capability**: can this build drive the harness
at all? The public baseline registers kiro-cli, Claude Code, KAS and Codex; an
edition plugin adds its own from ``ProviderRegistry.register_acp_backends`` by calling
:func:`register_selectable_backend`, the structural twin of
``publish_provider.register_provider``.

A LEAF module on purpose. ``kiro_crew/acp/__init__.py`` imports the ACP client and
runtime, so reaching ``kiro_crew.acp.types`` executes that package init and lands
back in ``config.loader`` — the cycle ``_normalize_acp_backend`` defers for.
That cycle is why the selectable list cannot be a **literal in three unrelated
places** (the loader's ``acp_backend`` field metadata, the dashboard's PATCH
allowlist, and ``acp.types``) with a drift test standing in for a code owner: none
of the three could import the others. Nothing here imports ``kiro_crew.acp``,
``kiro_crew.config`` or ``kiro_crew.platform``, so all three derive from this
module — and a plugin-registered backend reaches the dashboard without a core
edit, which a literal could never do.

Whether a registered backend may be selected on a *given deployment* is a separate
question (an enterprise policy bounding the fleet to one harness). It is
deliberately NOT answered here: it needs a governance ceiling, resolving a ceiling
reaches ``current_context()``, and that call's lazy branch loads config — so asking
it from :func:`resolve_selected_backend`, which runs inside
``KiroCrewConfig.load()``, re-enters that load and recurses. Keeping this module
capability-only is what makes the load path safe.

# ── The selectable registry ──

#: What the public edition ships.
#:
#: ``ACP_BACKEND_CLAUDE`` is included because the public build can genuinely serve a
#: session with it: ``acp/client.py`` owns the whole spawn path (the ``_is_claude``
#: branch, ``_resolve_claude_acp_bin``, ``_resolve_claude_code_executable``) and the
#: adapter it needs is a PUBLIC npm package (``CLAUDE_ACP_NPM_PKG``). Nothing about it
#: is edition-private. An earlier revision left it out and described it as a "dormant
#: seam ... not something a public build can serve a session with", which made the
#: option render as permanently unavailable on exactly the builds that could run it —
#: the switch was the only missing piece, not the harness.
#:
#: Whether it is USABLE on a given machine is a separate question with its own answer:
#: :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backend_install` probes for the two binaries and the
#: dashboard reports what is absent plus the command that installs it.
#:
#: ``ACP_BACKEND_CODEX`` is included, and the two things that were missing when it
#: was not are both worth naming, because each was a separate reason:
#:
#: * ``backend_install`` now has a probe, so the install row reads ``missing`` with
#:   the component and the command rather than ``unknown``. A switch that cannot say
#:   what is absent when a session fails is a switch offered ahead of the code that
#:   answers for it.
#: * its tool calls are ROUTED. ``acp_tool_gate`` verifies ``session/new``
#:   advertised ``mode=read-only`` and applies it before the first prompt, refusing
#:   the session otherwise, so the PreToolUse gate is armed for the calls it makes.
#:
#: One gap REMAINS and is survivable rather than closed: ACP v1 offers no way to
#: make an adapter ask for a passive READ, so the sensitive-path block cannot see
#: reads this harness performs. What made that dangerous was the credential homes
#: the standard sandbox tier leaves open, and those are denied to its child at the
#: OS boundary by ``acp_tool_gate.adapter_hidden_credential_dirs`` -- derived from
#: the read-gate floor itself, so the compensating control covers exactly what the
#: control it compensates for covers, minus the harness's own token store.

# Backends whose model-side REFUSAL arrives with a structured reason, not just a
# stop reason. When the Kiro service's content filter declines a turn, kiro-cli
# (and KAS, its relay) emit a ``_kiro.dev/metadata`` notification carrying
# ``stopReason: CONTENT_FILTERED`` plus a ``refusal`` object -- ``category``
# (``CYBER``, ...), the service's canned ``explanation``, and an optional
# ``recommendedModel`` -- milliseconds BEFORE the turn's terminal frame. Nothing
# in the terminal itself says why the turn stopped: the canned explanation is
# streamed as ordinary assistant text, and the ``session/prompt`` result may
# read ``end_turn`` or come back as a bare ``-32603 Internal error``.
#
# Membership decides whether :func:`kiro_crew.acp._dispatch.parse_refusal` is
# consulted on that notification. Every harness still lands on the SAME
# :class:`kiro_crew.acp.types.RefusalInfo` -- claude-agent-acp only reports
# Anthropic's ``stopReason: "refusal"`` with no reason attached, codex-acp
# likewise -- so a non-member is not "unsupported": its refusal card simply has
# no category line. The set exists so a future harness that carries its own
# reason payload is added HERE with a parser, rather than by widening the
# metadata reader to guess at every notification's shape.

# ── How a harness is made to ask ──
# Kiro Crew's PreToolUse gate -- the bundled denied-command rules, the
# sensitive-path block, the governance ceiling -- runs from exactly ONE place,
# ``HookManager.on_tool_call``, reached only from the permission-request branch of
# the dispatch parser. A harness that does not send ``session/request_permission``
# per tool call is a harness where none of those controls execute. So "how is this
# one made to ask?" is a security property, not a compatibility note, and it is
# named here rather than assumed at each call site.


class Routing(str, Enum):
    """The mechanism that makes a harness ask before it runs a tool.

    ``AGENT_SPEC`` -- the spawn names an agent, so the harness asks by
    construction and there is nothing to probe or apply.

    ``SESSION_CONFIG`` -- the ACP v1 session advertises a config option whose
    enforced value makes privileged tools ask. Kiro Crew verifies the option is
    advertised and applies it before the first prompt.

    ``SEEDED_SETTINGS`` -- the harness is made to ask by a settings file Kiro
    Crew writes, so the precondition would be confirmable by reading back what was
    written. **Declared but not enforced by this core**, because that read-back
    does not exist. ``AcpClient._write_claude_local_settings`` does seed
    ``permissions.defaultMode``, but it is a CONDITIONAL write: it touches only the
    file Crew owns (created this session, bytes still Crew's) and otherwise leaves
    the path alone, and nothing confirms the adapter honoured the mode afterwards.
    So a ``bypassPermissions`` already present in a user's own
    ``settings.local.json`` or ``~/.claude`` is neither detected nor stripped, and
    the guarantee cannot be asserted. Recorded as a known gap rather than papered
    over with a ``ROUTED`` this core cannot earn -- see
    ``docs/system-specs/modules/harness-onboarding.md``.

    ``UNVERIFIED`` -- Kiro Crew has NOT established how, or whether, this harness
    can be made to ask. This member exists so "we do not know" is a state a
    caller must handle rather than an absent case that falls through to a
    permissive branch. It always resolves INDETERMINATE, which refuses.
