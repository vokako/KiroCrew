"""Credential egress detection: URLs, OAuth tokens, IMDS and the egress gate.

The layer above output redaction. Redaction decides whether a run of text IS a
credential; this module decides whether a command or a URL is CARRYING one out,
so it reads redaction's shape predicates and redaction reads nothing from here.

Four surfaces: the URL and token layer (which URLs carry a credential in their
path or query, and the safe-diagnostic family that reports a finding as a
character-class shape rather than the bytes it matched), the data-egress command
gate, the IMDS address folder that collapses every alternate encoding of the
metadata address onto one dotted-quad, and the metadata check built on it.

The environment tier lives in ``denied_rules``: it resolves catalog rule ids to
row objects at import time, which is a dependency on the catalog rather than on
anything here.

# identity provider (Okta, Auth0, self-hosted OIDC, tenant-scoped Entra) is not
# in the launch set: its real consent URL routinely exceeds the query-length
# heuristic and the gate fails closed. The extension below restores an
# OPERATOR-owned escape hatch without weakening the ceiling for the agent:
#
# * the file lives on ``_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`` (read+write keystone), so the
#   agent can neither read nor author its own trust widening;
# * a missing/unreadable/corrupt/non-object file yields the EMPTY set — a
#   mangled file must never widen trust (same posture as
#   ``computer_use.enable_state.load_state``);
# * every entry is strictly validated (exact host+path, no wildcards, no
#   ports/userinfo/percent-escapes, no ``..``), and invalid entries are
#   SKIPPED with a warning rather than failing the whole file;
# * HTTPS-only / no-explicit-port stays enforced by the gate logic at both
#   call sites and is NOT relaxable via the file;
# * the exemption granted is identical to the builtin set's: only the
#   base64-blob/query-length heuristics on known ``_OAUTH_QUERY_PARAMS`` are
#   skipped — fixed-credential patterns, heavy percent-encoding, userinfo,
#   fragments, backslashes, and unknown-param heuristics remain unconditional.

    Sourced from the active ``PlatformContext``'s ``CredentialPolicy`` — the
    public Default returns an empty set (no exemptions), a loaded companion
    supplies its trusted-tenant host list.  NEVER read from ``config.json``: an
    agent-writable exemption would be a hole in the redaction ceiling.

    Import is FUNCTION-LOCAL (deferred, mirroring the ``sel.py`` pattern) so
    ``security`` never reaches ``kiro_crew.platform`` at module-load time — the
    CPP import-direction invariant (``platform/defaults.py`` imports ``security``
    at top level).

    Degrade semantics: EVERY failure degrades to ``frozenset()`` — the empty set
    means MORE redaction (every host runs the heuristics), the SAFE direction
    here, and it is stricter than any companion-supplied exemption list could
    be.  This lookup can only ever RELAX the heuristics, so there is no
    fail-closed to protect: propagating an error would convert "redact slightly
    more aggressively" into "the calling operation aborts", which took down every
    pooled MCP backend spawn in ``gatewayd`` (an unbooted worker that calls
    ``redact()`` on the spawn-log and stderr-drain paths).  Deliberately INVERTED
    vs ``redact_via_context``'s propagation: that seam substitutes a companion's
    redaction for the baseline, so a missing context there must not fail open.

    NO-CONTEXT FAST PATH: when no context is INSTALLED this returns the empty set
    without resolving one, via ``installed_context()``.  That is not merely an
    optimization, it is the only way to keep this off the event loop.  Resolving
    would load config + discover plugin entry points, and on a non-standalone
    profile ``current_context()`` never memoizes its fail-closed verdict, so a
    per-line caller (``_pump_stderr`` redacting backend stderr) would re-pay that
    synchronous I/O for every line.  The answer is unchanged either way: the
    public ``DefaultCredentialPolicy`` exempts no hosts, so a lazily-composed
    standalone default yields this same empty set, and an unbooted
    non-standalone process must not be handed exemptions at all.

    A pre-method companion adapter (no ``exempt_exact_hosts``) degrades to the
    empty set via ``getattr`` rather than raising.  NO logging on the degrade
    path: this runs inside the stdio MCP servers whose stray writes corrupt the

# heuristic classifies it as exfiltration and the user is shown
# ``[REDACTED: suspicious URL to api.slack.com]`` instead of the link the setup
# guide tells them to click.
#
# The carve-out VALIDATES rather than trusts the destination: the decoded payload
# must reproduce the bundled template, so an approved (host, path) carries no
# arbitrary bytes. A different path, an extra or missing parameter, a repeated
# parameter, or a payload that does not rebuild the template all keep the full
# heuristics. This is deliberately NOT a host exemption: ``_exempt_exact_hosts``
# is companion-owned tenant trust, and widening it here would exempt every URL at
# api.slack.com including a model-authored one.
#
# The ALIAS is the one caller-controlled span, so it does NOT ride free: the
# caller feeds it back through the base64-blob heuristic (see
# ``_exfil_url_warning``) instead of zeroing the heuristic payload. Zeroing it was
# a real bypass — the alias slot accepted 64 chars of ``[A-Za-z0-9_-]``, which is
# wide enough for a 40-char alphanumeric secret, and ``_EXFIL_PATTERNS`` needs a
# 40+ char run to fire. ``slack_manifest.ALIAS_MAX`` (32) now makes such a run
# impossible AND the surviving span is still scanned, so an ``AKIA…`` id or an
# ``xox…`` token short enough to fit is caught on the alias alone.
#
# Residual, stated rather than implied: an alias of up to ALIAS_MAX chars that
# resembles no known credential is exempt from the base64/length heuristics. That
# opens no NEW capability — any URL at any host may already carry a query under
# _EXFIL_QUERY_MIN_LEN (200) chars without tripping either heuristic, so this
# span is strictly narrower than what is available without the carve-out.

# ── IP Canonicalization (IMDS bypass prevention) ──
# Attackers bypass IMDS checks by encoding 169.254.169.254 in alternate forms:
#   - Decimal:   2852039166 (single 32-bit integer)
#   - Hex:       0xa9fea9fe or 0xa9.0xfe.0xa9.0xfe
#   - Octal:     0251.0376.0251.0376
#   - IPv6-mapped: ::ffff:169.254.169.254 or ::ffff:a9fe:a9fe
#   - Mixed:     169.254.0xa9.0376
# canonicalize_ip converts ALL these to dotted-quad for uniform matching.

# ── IMDS Access Detection ──
# The AWS Instance Metadata Service at 169.254.169.254 (link-local) exposes
# IAM role credentials via /latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/.
# Any HTTP client (not just curl/wget) hitting this IP must be blocked.

# Regex to extract potential IP addresses from a command string.
# Captures dotted-quad, hex/octal per-octet, bare integers, IPv6-mapped forms.
# One component of a dotted literal, in EVERY base the C resolver accepts: hex
# (``0x..``), C-style octal (a leading ``0``) or decimal. A digit run covers
# octal and decimal alike, so leading zeros are admitted in EVERY position.
# Spelling the bases per-position (the previous form) meant a MIXED encoding
# such as ``169.254.0251.0376`` matched no branch whole, so the token reached
# ``canonicalize_ip`` TRUNCATED and folded to a harmless address while the OS
# resolver still routed the full token to IMDS.
#
# UNBOUNDED on purpose. A length cap here is not a safety measure, it is the
# very defect being fixed: any cap truncates a padded spelling of the same
# address into a DIFFERENT, harmless one, so the gate fails open on
# ``0x0a9fea9fe`` and ``169.254.0x00000000a9.0376`` (glibc ``inet_aton``
# accepts both and routes them to IMDS). These are plain character classes
# with no nested quantifier, so an unbounded run is linear -- bounding buys no
# ReDoS protection and costs the match. The canonicalizer stays the strict
# half (it returns the input unchanged for anything that is not a real
# address), so admitting more candidates can only ever ADD a denial.
