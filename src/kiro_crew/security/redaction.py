"""Credential redaction on every output path.

This is the OUTPUT side of the module, and the widest external surface in it:
the batch redactors run on every path that persists, displays or forwards text,
so a name here is called from most of the codebase rather than from one caller.

The alternation and its pre-filter are ONE unit. The pre-filter is a documented
strict superset of the alternation, and the batch redactor SKIPS the scan
entirely when the pre-filter returns False, so an input the alternation would
have matched but the pre-filter rejects is a silent leak rather than a missed
optimisation. They are declared adjacent, with the comment that records the
relation, and the superset property is asserted by test.

The entropy machinery behind them answers a different question from the
alternation: a bare high-entropy run carries no marker to anchor on, so it is
judged by shape -- length, character classes, entropy, decodability -- and every
gate is a separate predicate so a refusal can name which one fired.

# ── Credential Output Redaction ──
# Catches raw credential patterns in LLM output / tool results,
# including base64-encoded variants.  Applied on all output paths
# alongside redact_exfiltration_urls().
#
# ⚠ THIS PATTERN HAS A DEPENDENT PRE-FILTER. `_might_contain_credential` below
# gates the scan of this pattern on a cheap necessary condition, and
# `redact_credentials` SKIPS the scan entirely when that gate returns False. The
# gate is therefore part of the redaction boundary, not an optimisation detail:
# any input a branch here accepts but the gate rejects is a silent leak.
#
# So EDITING A BRANCH IS A TWO-SITE CHANGE:
#   * ADDING a branch     -> register a sample in `test_credential_prefilter.py`
#                            and an anchor in `_might_contain_credential`.
#                            `test_every_pattern_branch_has_a_prefilter_anchor`
#                            fails on the branch count until you do.
#   * WIDENING a branch   -> widen the corresponding anchor to match, because the
#                            anchor must stay a SUPERSET of the branch. A widened
#                            branch does NOT change the branch count, so the count
#                            assertion cannot see it. Two tests cover this:
#                            `test_a_widened_branch_cannot_outgrow_its_anchor`
#                            enumerates each branch's own alternatives, so a NEW
#                            alternative (a second token prefix) is caught; and
#                            `test_widening_a_branch_cannot_outgrow_its_anchor`
#                            perturbs each sample, so a case-fold or homoglyph
#                            relaxation is caught.
#   * Making a branch CASE-INSENSITIVE -> the anchor MUST use the same regex
#                            engine. A case-sensitive literal cannot gate a
#                            `(?i:…)` branch, and neither can `str.lower()` —
#                            see `_CREDENTIAL_PREFILTER_AUTHORIZATION_RE` for the
#                            bypass that cost.

    # Two mutually exclusive tails after the header:
    #   1. Full block — ``[\s\S]*?`` (any char, incl. newlines) spans the body
    #      lazily to the first END marker. ``[\s\S]`` (not a base64 char class)
    #      is required so encrypted keys — whose ``Proc-Type:``/``DEK-Info:``
    #      headers carry ``:`` and ``,`` — are fully spanned rather than cut
    #      short at the first non-base64 char.
    #   2. Truncated block (no END) — consume only *subsequent* PEM body lines:
    #      each continuation must start with a newline and be a base64 line or a
    #      ``Proc-Type:``/``DEK-Info:`` metadata header. This deliberately does
    #      NOT use ``$``/``\Z``: without re.MULTILINE ``$`` means end-of-STRING,
    #      so a lazy ``[\s\S]*?`` with a ``|$`` fallback swallowed everything
    #      from a header mentioned inline in prose (LLM output, docs) to the end
    #      of the string — silently deleting all trailing lines. Requiring a
    #      leading newline per line means an inline header in prose (real key
    #      material always begins on the line *after* the header) matches only
    #      the header phrase, leaving trailing content intact, while a genuine
    #      truncated key still has its body lines redacted.
    #      The final ``(?=\r?\n[A-Za-z0-9+/=])`` lookahead alternative lets the
    #      run cross a SINGLE blank line when the *next* line begins with base64
    #      material. RFC 1421 ENCRYPTED PEMs put a MANDATORY blank line between
    #      the ``DEK-Info:`` header and the base64 body; without this lookahead
    #      the per-line "every continuation must contain a base64 char" rule
    #      stopped at that blank line and leaked the whole encrypted body (for
    #      both a truncated key AND a complete encrypted key whose body exceeds
    #      the full-block cap). Because the lookahead consumes nothing, TWO+
    #      consecutive blank lines still terminate the run — trailing prose is

    # ── JWT / JWE / OAuth Bearer tokens ──
    # `eyJ` is the base64url encoding of every JWT header's `{"` prefix; a signed
    # JWT (JWS) is three `.`-separated base64url segments (header.payload.sig), an
    # encrypted JWT (JWE, RFC 7516) is five (header.key.iv.ciphertext.tag), and our
    # OWN dashboard link token is two — `base64url(payload).base64url(hmac_sig)`,
    # see `dashboard.token_auth.generate_token`. The 3-and-5-segment shapes are
    # matched by the `{2,4}` quantifier below; the 2-segment link token has its
    # OWN separately bounded alternative.
    #
    # The floor stays at 2 because the two-segment dashboard token is what a higher
    # floor drops: it would not match here at all and would fall through to the
    # bare-secret entropy pass, whose run class `[A-Za-z0-9+/]` is STANDARD base64
    # and excludes base64url's `-`/`_`. That makes redaction depend on which
    # characters a random HMAC signature happens to contain. That rate is derivable,
    # so it is stated as a closed form rather than as a sample. HMAC-SHA256 is 256
    # bits and base64url-unpadded gives 43 chars. The first 42 each carry a full 6
    # bits, so each is uniform over the 64-char alphabet, of which exactly 2 are
    # `-`/`_`. The 43rd carries only the leftover 4 bits (256 - 42*6), and they
    # land in the HIGH bits of its 6-bit
    # group with the low 2 bits zero, so it spans exactly the 16 alphabet indices
    # divisible by 4 (`048AEIMQUYcgkosw`) and can never be `-`/`_`, which sit at
    # 62/63. Hence P(no `-`/`_`) = (62/64)^42 = 26.4%, verified by encoding all
    # 256 possible final digest bytes.
    # So roughly a quarter of tokens would have only the signature replaced (leaving
    # the payload claims verbatim in a URL that still looks complete but is not
    # authenticated), and the other ~74% would stream out entirely unredacted.
    # Matching the whole token here makes the outcome deterministic and replaces it
    # as one unit. The 2-segment token gets its OWN alternative rather than
    # relaxing the segment floor to `{1,4}`. Relaxing
    # the floor over-redacts ordinary code and prose, because the pattern has no left
    # boundary and post-header segments allow an EMPTY match: `keyJson.get(raw)` then
    # redacts to `k[REDACTED…](raw)`, and a JWT quoted at the end of a sentence loses
    # its trailing period. The 2-segment alternative therefore carries a left boundary
    # (`(?<![A-Za-z0-9_.-])`, as `_BARE_SECRET_RUN_RE` already does, plus `.` so an
    # attribute access `obj.eyJ…` is excluded too) and per-segment lengths taken from
    # the generator, not from guesswork, because a length FLOOR alone is beatable by a
    # sufficiently verbose identifier: at `{40,}` the 40-char
    # `eyJsonSerializerConfigurationFactoryBuilder.deserializeFromStringValue` matched.
    #
    # `token_auth._sign` is HMAC-SHA256 base64url-unpadded, so the signature is
    # EXACTLY 43 chars for every token ever minted; that is a property of the digest,
    # not of the payload, so it is pinned as `{43}` rather than a floor. See
    # `test_link_token_signature_is_43_chars`, which fails loudly if `_sign` changes
    # digest, instead of letting redaction silently stop matching.
    #
    # `generate_token` always emits 6 claims (`sub`/`exp`/`session_exp`/`iat`/`nonce`/
    # `gen`), with a 16-hex-char nonce and float timestamps; `app`, `prompt` and
    # `extra` only ADD. Payload length is NOT fixed. It scales with `len(sub)`, and
    # `json.dumps` writes each float timestamp at its own repr width, which base64
    # then quantises into 4-char steps. So the floor is derived, not sampled: a
    # 1-char `sub` (the narrowest a caller passes: the app validator requires at
    # least one char and the other call sites supply a literal fallback), `gen=0`,
    # and all three timestamps at their shortest 12-char repr (an exactly-integral
    # `time.time()` in the current 10-digit epoch era) measures 145 chars past
    # `eyJ`, which leaves the `{96,}` floor 49 chars of headroom against a future
    # shorter claim set while still excluding `eyJ2IjoxfQ.json`. ONLY that derived
    # floor is pinned, by `test_link_token_payload_clears_the_96_char_floor`, which
    # reads the bound from the compiled pattern and the claim keys from a real mint
    # so a dropped claim fails loudly instead of silently disabling redaction. Live
    # payloads are much larger and are NOT pinned, because the exact spread moves
    # with float reprs and caller mix: measured 168-185 for the mandatory-only
    # callers and 192-223 for the two that also pass `app=` (`handlers/core.py`,
    # `token_auth.py`), which adds an `"app"` claim.
    #
    # Order matters: the 3-to-5-segment
    # alternative is tried first at each position, so a real JWS still redacts whole
    # instead of matching `header.payload` and leaving `.signature` exposed.
    # The 3-to-5-segment alternative keeps `*` (not `+`) on post-header segments so an
    # EMPTY segment still counts: a compact JWE with direct
    # (`alg:dir`) or key-agreement (`ECDH-ES`) key management has an empty Encrypted
    # Key (2nd) segment — shape `header..iv.ciphertext.tag` — which a `+` quantifier
    # would fail to match, leaking the ciphertext + tag.
    # The HTTP `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header carries opaque or JWT bearer
    # creds. The JWT alternative is case-sensitive (`eyJ` is a fixed base64url
    # prefix). The header name + scheme are matched case-insensitively via scoped
    # `(?i:…)` groups because HTTP header names are case-insensitive (RFC 7230
    # §3.2), HTTP/2 mandates lowercase names, and the `Bearer` scheme is
    # case-insensitive (RFC 6750 §2.1) — so `authorization: bearer …` emitted by
    # requests / net/http / HTTP2 frame logs is redacted too. The separator is
    # JSON-aware: an optional quote may precede the
    # `:`/`=` and the token, so a serialized header `{"Authorization": "Bearer
    # <tok>"}` in a structured-log/JSON request dump is redacted as well. Both
    # alternatives are scoped tightly: the JWT segment class cannot cross the
    # literal `.` separators and the Bearer token class (`[A-Za-z0-9._~+/-]`, RFC
    # 6750 `b64token`) stops at whitespace/quotes, so neither over-captures. A
    # Bearer header carrying a JWT redacts as one match (the Bearer class subsumes
    # the JWT); a bare JWT is still caught independently (defense in depth).

# ── Cheap pre-filter for `_CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS` (performance only) ──
# `_CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS` is a 23-branch alternation, so `re` retries every branch
# at essentially every position: measured 117 ns/char, and it is the single
# hottest line in the gateway's event loop (38.2% of all py-spy samples, reached
# per message per dirty-slot flush). The scan cost is paid in full even though
# real text almost never contains a credential — measured 0 matches across 1,804
# live session-history messages (1.47 MB).
#
# So `_might_contain_credential` answers the cheap question "could a match exist
# at all?" and lets `redact_credentials` skip the expensive scan when the answer
# is no. It is a strict SUPERSET of `_CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS`, i.e. for every string
# the pattern matches, this returns True. That direction is the security
# property: a false POSITIVE only costs a scan we would have run anyway, while a
# false NEGATIVE would skip redaction and leak a credential into persisted chat
# history. Every condition below is therefore a NECESSARY condition of a branch,
# never a restatement of it — each is deliberately looser than the branch it
# stands in for.
#
# THE MAINTENANCE HAZARD this is built against: adding a 24th branch to
# `_CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS` without adding a matching anchor here would silently
# disable redaction for it. Nothing about the pattern edit would look wrong, and
# the failure is invisible in output — the branch simply stops firing. So
# `test_credential_prefilter.py` splits `_CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS.pattern` on its
# top-level `|`, asserts the branch count equals the number of registered sample
# credentials, and asserts the pre-filter fires for each. A new branch fails that
# count assertion loudly instead of quietly widening the leak.

    The result is compared against :data:`_SECRET_ENTROPY_MIN` by

    NOT a statistic anybody displays. A one-ULP drift at the boundary flips that
    verdict, and a flip in the permissive direction leaks a credential. The
    optimisation below is therefore built to be BIT-IDENTICAL, not merely close,
    and is pinned that way by ``TestShannonEntropyIsBitIdentical``.

    Each addend is ``(c / length) * log2(c / length)``. The sole production caller
    reaches this only through the exactly-``_SECRET_KEY_LEN`` check in
    :func:`_looks_like_secret_key`, and reaches it over and over --
    :func:`_contains_bare_secret` slides a 40-char window byte by byte across each
    base64-alphabet run that clears its prefilters -- so at that one length every
    addend is drawn from the fixed set :data:`_ENTROPY_TERMS_KEY_LEN` holds. That
    retires TWO true divisions and one ``math.log2`` call per DISTINCT CHARACTER per
    call -- ``c / length`` appears twice in the expression and CPython evaluates it
    twice, and a 40-char base64 window holds ~30 distinct characters -- plus the
    generator frames, in favour of a C-level ``map`` over a tuple index.

    Any other length takes the inline formula, unchanged from before the table
    existed. That keeps the fast path to the single length that is actually asked
    for, so no size cap or cache-eviction policy is needed to bound what an
    arbitrary caller could make this allocate.

    Why this is bit-identical rather than approximately equal:

    * Each addend is produced by the same three IEEE-754 operations on the same
      operands as before -- divide, ``log2``, multiply -- so each addend carries
      the same bit pattern. Precomputation changes WHEN a term is computed, never
      HOW.
    * ``Counter(token).values()`` still supplies the addends, in the same
      first-occurrence order, and ``map`` is consumed in order, so ``sum``
      accumulates identical addends in an identical sequence. The equality
      therefore does not rest on float addition being associative, which it is
      not. An algebraic rearrangement such as
      ``log2(length) - sum(c * log2(c)) / length`` IS mathematically equal and is
      measurably NOT bit-equal, which is why it is not used here.

    ``TestSecretGateOrderIsCostOrdered``.

    Putting the two cheap structural gates ahead of the entropy computation, and
    the decode check last, halves the cost of gates 4-7 and measured -47% on
    ``redact_credentials`` end to end. Do not reorder these back into

    4. No lowercase run longer than _SECRET_MAX_LOWER_RUN.
    5. Vowel ratio <= _SECRET_MAX_VOWEL_RATIO. Gates 4 and 5 are the
       structural-randomness pair: they separate a random key from word-based
       identifiers and slash-delimited file paths that survive the entropy
       floor. Both apply to EVERY token (a '/' or '+' does not exempt a token,
       so 40-char mixed-case file paths stay intact).
    6. Shannon entropy >= _SECRET_ENTROPY_MIN (rejects low-entropy repeats/prose
       and most code identifiers, which cluster below 4.3).
    7. Does not base64-decode to printable text (rejects encoded-text blobs).

    adjacent base64 char with no delimiter (e.g. ``X`` + key, key + ``A``,
    ``SECRET=`` + key + ``ABC``, key + ``X`` + key) forms a 41+ char run that would

#: (bare secret runs) write ``_REDACTED_CREDENTIAL_TAG``, pass 2 (base64-encoded)
#: writes ``_REDACTED_ENCODED_CREDENTIAL_TAG``.
#:
#: Scope is deliberately CREDENTIALS ONLY, and a consumer must not read it as "was
#: this text rewritten at all". :func:`redact_exfiltration_urls` is a separate
#: rewriter that substitutes ``[REDACTED: suspicious URL to <domain>]`` -- a
#: variable string, so it is prefix-matched rather than compared, which is why it
#: is not a member here. Its stable prefix is exported as
#: :data:`kiro_crew.security.exfil.EXFILTRATION_REDACTION_TAG_PREFIX` (beside
#: the rewriter itself), and a consumer that needs the full "was this text
#: rewritten" answer must check that constant by prefix ALONGSIDE this tuple --
#: the dashboard chat notice does exactly that.
#:
#: This tuple exists so the enumeration lives beside the tags instead of at the
#: call site, where it silently misses a tag and under-reports redactions on the
#: dashboard chat notice. Co-locating it means a NEW tag is added next to the list
#: that must name it; ``test_every_redaction_tag_constant_is_registered`` fails if
#: one is added without registering it, so the drift cannot happen silently.
#:
#: Invariant relied on by callers that SUM per-tag counts: no tag is a substring
#: of another, so one substitution cannot be counted twice.
