"""The argv-structural self-protection floor: a floor that reads argv, not text.

Always on, and deliberately not a regex tier. Every predicate here answers a
question about a command's STRUCTURE -- which token is the program, which token
is a subcommand, which token is a redirection target, which payload a nested
interpreter would actually run -- so the product's own name appearing somewhere
in a path, a search pattern or a commit message is not on its own an answer.
That distinction is the whole reason the floor exists beside the catalog: the
catalog matches text and can be pinned or opted out of, while these predicates
are the last word on the handful of actions that must never succeed no matter
what the settings say.

Three families live here:

* Release detection, which recognises a publish invocation by its subcommand
  position rather than by the verb appearing anywhere, then decides whether the
  refspec it carries names a protected branch. It fails CLOSED: an invocation
  whose target cannot be read cleanly is refused rather than guessed at.
* Termination, restart, update and destructive-cloud subcommand floors, which
  recognise the product as the argv's own program and the action as its own
  subcommand.
* The credential-mint predicates, which follow a payload through the carriers
  that can hand it to an interpreter -- an inline program, a here-document, a
  standard-input redirection, a nested shell -- and ask whether the product's
  package is imported in it.

Writes INTO the governance data home are not a floor here: the OS sandbox mounts
the keystone read-only in every mode, so an archive or copy destination flag
aimed at it is refused by the kernel rather than by a matcher over the command's
text.

Layer. This module sits above the shell reader and reads its word layer, the
shared name vocabulary below it, and one sentinel the rule catalog owns for a
floor denial that no catalog pattern matches. It imports nothing from the facade,
so the dependency runs one way.

The audit emitter for an allowed feature-branch push is NOT here. It belongs to
the tier that decides to allow, which is the evaluator, and it redacts the
command it records through the output-redaction side; keeping it beside the
evaluator is what keeps this module free of that edge.

# ── Git publish detection (verb-anchored) ──
# ``git push`` must be blocked, but ``push`` appearing anywhere in arbitrary
# command text (a commit message, a branch name, a grep pattern, an ssh remote
# payload) must NOT trip the deny.  We therefore require ``push`` to be the git
# *subcommand* — i.e. the first non-flag/non-option token after ``git`` — rather
# than a substring.  Mirrors the anchored regex in
# ``config/defaults.json`` deniedCommands.
#
# ``git [<-c k=v>...] [<-C path>...] push ...`` is a publish.  Intervening
# tokens may only be options (``-x``) or option-with-value pairs
# (``-C /path``, ``-c core.x=y``) — a bare non-flag token before ``push``
# (e.g. ``stash``) means ``push`` is NOT the subcommand, so ``git stash push``
# is correctly allowed.  Anchored to a segment start (optionally preceded by a
# command separator) so ``git log --grep push`` is not matched.
#
# The trailing terminator is a lookahead that accepts whitespace, end-of-string,
# OR a shell metacharacter that closes/terminates the segment — so a bare
# ``git push`` (no remote/branch, valid: pushes current branch to the default
# remote) is still caught inside ``$(git push)``, `` `git push` ``, ``git push|cat``,
# ``git push&``, etc., not just when followed by a space.

    # an ambiguity that backtracks exponentially (ReDoS) on whitespace-laden

    * ``<<TAG`` / ``<<-TAG`` -- a heredoc; the BODY up to the matching tag is the program.
      An unterminated one runs to the end of the run, which over-yields, not under.
    * ``<<<WORD`` -- a here-string; the WORD itself is the program.
    * ``<WORD`` -- a file whose CONTENT is the program.
    * ``< <(cmd)`` -- process substitution; the command text is visible and spans tokens
      up to its closing paren, so it is yielded as a run.
    * ``<&N`` -- an fd dup, which carries no text at all; a documented residual.

    Walked as a RUN rather than "everything after the interpreter" because a
    redirection may appear ANYWHERE in a simple command -- BEFORE the program name
    (``<<'PY' python -``), after it, and GLUED TO IT with no space
    (``python3<<<'…'``, ``python3<prog.py``), all of which are ordinary bash reaching
    the same mint (each caught in review, GPT 5.6).  A token that carries a redirect
    after some other text is therefore classified from its first ``<`` onward: the
    text before it is the program name or an earlier operand, and the shell reads the
    rest as the redirection.

    The left-hand run is not split on a newline, so an earlier command's own stdin
    redirect is yielded too -- the same deliberate over-block the pipe producer has,
    and for the same reason.

    A heredoc's body ends at the LAST token equal to its tag, not the first.  Bash
    closes a heredoc only on a line that holds the delimiter ALONE, and line structure
    does not survive tokenizing -- so a body line that merely CONTAINS the word
    (``# EOF``, an ordinary Python comment) produced a token equal to the tag and closed
    the body early, leaving the real payload after it unscanned (caught in review, GPT
    5.6).  The last occurrence is the delimiter that actually ends it; taking it
    over-yields only when the tag word recurs in a LATER command, which is the safe

    """The tokens that can carry the PROGRAM a stdin-reading ``python`` will run.

    ``tokens[i]`` is an interpreter that reads its program from stdin.  The shell can
    fill that stdin from exactly two families, and this yields those and nothing else:

    * a stdin REDIRECTION -- heredoc body, here-string word, redirected file or process
      substitution -- anywhere in the command: before the program name, after it, or
      glued to it (:func:`_stdin_redirect_carriers`).  Walked over the WHOLE frame in ONE
      pass, not per side of the interpreter: a marker and its body can straddle the
      program name (``<<EOF python - … EOF``), and splitting the walk lost that
      association entirely (caught in review, GPT 5.6).  Only REDIRECT OPERANDS are
      yielded, so a neighbouring command's ordinary argument is still never program text;
    * a PIPE PRODUCER -- the tokens left of this interpreter, when a pipe feeds it.
      The pipe is NOT reliably its own token: the tokenizer splits on whitespace only,
      so ``echo '…'|python -`` glues the operator into a neighbouring word and
      ``_program_basename`` resolves the program from the LAST control-operator
      segment.  So the pipe is detected as a CHARACTER anywhere left of, or glued
      into, the interpreter token, and that token's own leading segment is producer
      text.  Requiring a standalone ``|`` token would miss all four no-space spellings
      and let the producer's payload through.

    Both families over-yield on the left: any pipe, or any earlier command's own stdin
    redirect, qualifies.  That is the safe direction -- a missed carrier is a bypass,
    an extra token is only a visible refusal (pinned by a test).

    Everything else in the frame is another command's argv.  Scanning THAT is the
    defect: a frame is not split on a newline, so an unrelated neighbour that
    merely names this package in a FILE PATH (``isort src/kiro_crew/mcp_core.py``

# ── Self-protection floor short-circuit (perf) ──
# The floor predicates below re-tokenize the command and descend every nested
# shell payload (`_self_token_frames`), which is where the cost of the deny
# scan concentrates: it scales with NESTING COMPLEXITY, and each `is_denied`
# call runs the descent three times (mint once, kill twice). The common tool
# call — a tool name plus a path — can never fire either predicate, so the
# descent is pure waste there.
#
# The gate is a NECESSARY condition, deliberately wider than a raw
# `_SELF_NAME_RE` search. That narrower gate is UNSOUND: the
# predicates fire on inputs whose raw text never matches `kiro[-.]?crew` —
# `python -m kiro_crew token` (the underscored import spelling), `[k]irocrew
# token` (one-char bracket class), `kiro$()crew` (empty substitution),
# `kiro${x:-crew}` (parameter default), `bash -c "\x6birocrew token"` (printf
# escapes), `kiro?rew` (glob the shell expands before exec), and a `-c`
# payload reaching the CLI through `exec`/`b64decode` with no name at all.
# Every one of those is denied by the floor, so a gate that skipped them would
# be a real bypass, not an optimization.
#
# Sound formulation: the floor can only fire if, after the normalizations the
# predicates themselves apply (shlex quote-stripping, `_debracket`,
# `_resolve_param_defaults`, `_EMPTY_SUBST_RE`, `_decode_printf_escapes`,
# `_glob_could_expand_to`), the text yields a self name/module — or an inline
# dynamic-exec primitive stands in for it. Each normalization needs specific
# MACHINERY characters present in the raw text, so the union below is a
# superset of every firing path:
#   * the literal name in any spelling (`kiro[-._]?crew` — underscore included
#     for the module/import form, which `_SELF_NAME_RE` deliberately omits);
#   * any machinery character that lets a normalization synthesize the name or
#     a program spelling: glob/brace chars (`? * [ ] { }` — `_glob_could_expand_to`
#     admits e.g. `k*w` for the program AND `*kill` for the kill verbs),
#     `$` (substitutions, parameter defaults, ANSI-C quoting), backticks, and
#     `~` (tilde expansion — the kill predicates expanduser their targets, so
#     `pkill -f ~` IS a self-kill whenever $HOME lies under the product tree,
#     with no name and no other machinery in the raw text);
#   * printf numeric escapes (`\xHH`, `\NNN`) that can spell arbitrary
#     characters once `_decode_printf_escapes` runs on a nested payload;
#   * the dynamic-exec markers `_inline_payload_reaches_cli` accepts in place
#     of a literal import — checked on the raw text AND on the quote-stripped
#     text, because empty-quote glue hides the verb exactly as it hides the
#     name (`python -c "ex""ec(...)"` carries no name and no other machinery,
#     yet the floor denies it);
#   * the literal name after stripping quotes/backslashes (`k""iro""crew`,
#     `ki\rocrew` — shlex removes those before the predicates compare).
# When none of these is present, no predicate can return True, so the descent
# is skipped. False positives (e.g. any `$VAR` in a command) merely fall back
# to the full scan — the safe direction.
#
# Matched WITHOUT re.IGNORECASE on purpose: the floor's own contract is that

    """Substitution bodies inside a bare ``kill``'s own argv, read from the RAW text.

    The token walk in :func:`_is_self_kill` bounds the same window with
    :func:`_substitution_depth_delta`, which counts parens on tokens
    ``normalize_shell_command`` has already stripped the quotes from -- so by the
    time the counter runs, a QUOTED close-paren is indistinguishable from a real
    closer and it ends the window early: ``kill $(printf ')' ; pgrep -f
    kirocrew)`` scored the quoted paren as depth -1, cut the argv at the ``;``,
    and dropped the ``pgrep`` clause that names the target -- while bash, whose
    substitution scan is quote-aware, runs that ``pgrep`` (measured).

    The raw text still HAS the quotes, so the window is re-derived here from the
    same quote-aware machinery the extractor uses (:func:`_iter_shell_chars`
    for the walk, :func:`_matching_close_paren` for each span): a separator
    splits a segment only OUTSIDE quotes and OUTSIDE any substitution span, and
    a body is attributed only when it sits AFTER a top-level word that resolves
    to ``kill`` in the SAME segment.  Both bounds carry weight: the segment
    bound keeps ``kill 123; echo $(cat /tmp/kirocrew)`` allowed (the
    substitution belongs to the ``echo``), and the forward bound keeps
    ``LOG=$(ls /tmp/kirocrew.log) kill 4242`` allowed (the substitution
    precedes the kill, so it is an environment word's value, not the kill's
    operand) -- the exact false positive the token walk's own scoping replaced.

    Three quoting rules are load-bearing, each bash-measured (pre-push review):

    * A substitution body is parsed in its OWN NEUTRAL quote context, because
      that is how bash reads ``$( )`` -- a ``$(`` inside double quotes closes at
      an interior ``)`` even though the outer quote is still open.  The walk
      then RESUMES with the outer quote state it carried into the opener, so
      ``echo "$(date)" ; kill $(...)`` keeps its ``;`` as a real separator and
      the kill segment is still scanned.
    * A backtick closer is found through an escape-skipping scan: within
      backticks a backslash escapes ``\\``` and the escaped backtick is DATA,
      so taking it as the closer would truncate the body before the clause
      that names the target.
    * ``&>`` / ``&>>`` (and the trailing ``2>&1`` form) are redirects of the
      SAME simple command, not separators -- splitting there discarded the
      ``kill`` word before its substitution was attributed.

    A word GLUED to a substitution (``kill$(x)``, ``LOG=$(x)``) is never the
    bare ``kill`` this scan attributes to: bash joins the expansion into the
    word, so the program it runs is not the literal word prefix.  Glued words
    are flagged and excluded from the kill match, which keeps
    ``echo kill$(printf kirocrew)`` -- where ``kill...`` is an argument of
    ``echo`` -- out of the deny set.

    Words collect what the shell PASSES, not what the operator typed: a quote
    character that is quote SYNTAX (an opener or closer -- the state machine's
    own transitions say which) is dropped, while a quote character that is DATA
    (inside the other quote type, or escaped) is kept.  Without that,
    ``k''ill`` reaches the comparison spelled with its splice and the kill is
    missed (bash-measured: the spliced spelling runs
    ``kill``).  A syntax quote still OPENS a word -- ``''#`` is the word ``#``,
    not a comment -- which the ``open_word`` flag carries.

    An UNPROVEN span (parens that never balance) takes the whole remainder as
    the body and ends the walk.  That cannot under-detect: bash cannot execute
    past an unterminated substitution either (the whole line is a syntax
    error), so there is no later command to lose -- while the remainder still
    reaches the name search attributed to the CURRENT segment, which is what
    keeps the decoyed-and-unbalanced spelling detected.

    A top-level ``#`` starting a word begins a comment, which ends at the next
    newline; the skip lands ON that newline so the segment boundary it carries
    is still honoured.

    This pass is a UNION with the token walk, never a replacement: the tokens
    carry resolutions the raw text does not (``p=$(pgrep -f kirocrew); kill $p``
    resolves ``$p`` at tokenization) and the raw text carries the quoting the
    tokens lost.  Keeping both is what guarantees no spelling either half
    detects is dropped.
