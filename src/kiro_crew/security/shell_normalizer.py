"""Shell text reader: tokenizer, quote and escape state machine, argv attribution.

Every tier that judges a command line reads it through this module. Nothing here
decides anything: it reconstructs what a shell would see -- splitting a line into
statements and words, tracking quote and escape state, peeling redirections and
substitutions off a word, attributing a token to the program that receives it,
decoding the escape forms a printer would emit, and reading the expansion shapes
whose value is unknowable without running the line.

That division is deliberate and load-bearing. A reader that under-approximates
blinds every tier at once, and no OS sandbox sees shell text, so this layer
over-approximates on purpose and the tiers above it are where precision belongs.
Narrowing a matcher means narrowing the site that DECIDES, never this one.

Imports only ``vocabulary``, the layer below, for the product's own name: the
tiers depend on the reader, never the reverse.

    A redirect needs no whitespace in front of it, so it can ride on the back of any

    and bash runs the here-string. The detector only recognised a redirect at the START of

    ``<`` branch has always looked for its operator ANYWHERE in the word; this is the same
    rule for the ``>`` family, and that asymmetry was the gap.

    The word is SPLIT rather than skipped, because what precedes the redirect decides the
    answer and only the caller's own branches can classify it: ``-u`` is a flag and the
    scan continues, but ``script.py>out`` means the script supplies the program and the
    answer is False. Measured in bash: ``python script.py> out <<< '<program>'`` runs the
    script, not the here-string. Splitting and re-reading both halves reuses that
    classification instead of duplicating it, so the two cannot drift apart.

    None when the word has no ``>`` at all, or already begins with a redirect -- a leading
    file descriptor belongs to the redirect, and the shell only reads digits as one when

def _output_redirect_scan(raw: str, start: int = 0) -> "tuple[str, int] | None":
    """``(target, end)`` for the OUTPUT redirect at *start* in *raw*, or None.

    ``python 2>&1 <<< '<program>'`` runs the here-string, but the detector had no branch
    for the ``>`` family at all: it handles ``<`` and heredocs off the raw token and let
    everything else fall through to "this is a script path". The unnumbered glued form
    only survived by accident, because ``_normalize_operand`` reduces ``>out.txt`` to the
    empty string and the loop skips empties -- while ``2>&1`` reduces to ``2``, a
    perfectly good file name, so the interpreter looked like it was running a script
    called ``2`` and the program on its stdin went unscanned.

    Every spelling is a redirect and none is ever a positional: an optional leading file
    DESCRIPTOR -- a number, ``&`` for both streams, or a ``{name}`` automatic descriptor
    -- then ``>`` or ``>>``, then an optional ``&`` for the duplicating form or ``|`` for
    the noclobber override.

    The target STOPS at the next redirect operator, and *end* is that position, because
    the shell starts a new redirect there: in ``python 2>/dev/null<<EOF`` the word is one
    token, and taking all of ``/dev/null<<EOF`` as the target swallows the heredoc marker
    and loses the program that arrives on stdin.

    Only at substitution depth ZERO, though. A redirect inside ``$(...)``, ``${...}`` or
    backticks belongs to that inner command and is not a boundary of this word:
    ``python 2>$(echo>/dev/null;printf /dev/null) <<< '<program>'`` really is
    ``python 2>/dev/null`` once the shell has run the substitution, and cutting the target
    at the inner ``>`` left the tail of the substitution to be read as a script path,
    which put the stdin program back out of view. The whole substitution is one shell
    WORD, and :func:`_operand_span_end` is what carries it across the tokens it spans.

    Depth counts every ``(`` and ``{`` INSIDE a substitution, but at depth zero only a
    ``$``-prefixed opener starts one. A subshell nested inside a substitution
    (``$( (true); printf /dev/null)``) closes with its own ``)`` -- counting the opener
    but not that one would drop the depth to zero early and reopen exactly the hole
    this closes. A BARE opener at depth zero is different: the tokenizer that feeds
    this scan strips quotes (``_self_token_frames`` shlex-splits, and the caller also
    edge-strips), so a quoted ``(`` -- one filename character to bash -- arrived here
    bare, opened a span that never closed, and the target ran past the ``<<<`` that
    should have ended it. The here-string was absorbed into the target and the program
    arriving on stdin went unscanned: measured in bash, ``python 2>'a)(b'<<<'<program>'``
    runs the program, and so does the unquoted-brace spelling ``python 2>a{b<<<'<program>'``
    (a bare ``{`` is an ordinary filename character). An UNQUOTED bare ``(`` cannot
    reach execution at all -- bash rejects ``2>a(b`` as a syntax error -- so at depth
    zero the only executable meaning of a bare opener is a filename character, and the
    walk now reads it as one. *raw* must reach here with its substitution delimiters
    intact; see the caller.

    Quote CHARACTERS in *raw* are data, never grammar. The tokenizer resolved quoting
    before this scan runs, so a quote character that survives is literal text from a
    spelling like ``2>"a'b"`` -- and reading it as grammar is the same defect in the
    opposite direction: a single-quote state opened on that data quote consumed the
    ``<<<`` to the end of the text and hid the operator (found in review, First
    Principles lane). The walk therefore steps over quote characters like any other
    filename character. Residuals, tracked rather than chased: a quoted ``'$('`` or
    a quoted backtick in a filename de-quotes to the same characters as real grammar
    and still holds or toggles a span -- indistinguishable without the quoting the
    tokenizer already destroyed, and closing that class needs quote-preserving
    tokenization at the frame level, not another rule here.

    An INDEX is returned rather than the remaining text so a word holding a chain of
    them (``>a>a>a...``) can be walked once. Re-slicing the word per operator was
    quadratic in its length, on a floor that runs for every command -- the same defect
    class this module pins against elsewhere, so it is not reintroduced here.

    Four readings each keeping their own copy would not agree. A word splitter
    with no ANSI-C awareness where the boundary walk has it reads the ESCAPED
    quote in ``git push origin feature > >(echo $'a\\'b') main`` as a real
    closer, reopens on the next quote, and fuses the trailing ``main`` into one
    unterminated word -- the boundary walk then proves its parenthesis
    correctly, but the protected refspec is already trapped inside the word it
    was handed. That is the two-scanners defect this module is structurally
    cured of: one machine, several consumers, no second opinion to drift from.

    Bash's rules, once: a backslash escapes the next character outside quotes,
    inside double quotes, and inside ``$'...'``, but is LITERAL inside a plain
    single quote; an escaped quote is data and closes nothing. The ``$'``
    lookback is within-text, which is correct because whitespace cannot sit
    between the ``$`` and its quote, and it is EXACT: only a literal, unpaired
    ``$`` (an odd run -- ``$$`` is the PID parameter, ``\\$`` is data) opens
    ANSI-C. That exactness is load-bearing now that the segment split and the
    program anchor read this state in the allow direction: a walk that ends
    "still open" where bash closed hides a separator or a ``git`` word.

    ``strip`` is not enough: an operator can sit in the MIDDLE of a naive

    ``mainline)>log`` -- which ends in ``g``, so stripping removed nothing and the
    ref never equalled ``mainline``. bash parses that as the ref ``mainline``
    followed by the operator ``)`` and the redirection ``>log``, so cutting at the
    first operator is what reproduces its reading.

    Quote state is TRACKED rather than bailed on. Inside quotes these characters
    are literal and a ref may legitimately contain them -- ``git push origin
    '(main)'`` targets a branch actually named ``(main)``, which is not protected
    and must stay pushable. But a quoted ref can still carry an operator OUTSIDE
    its quotes: ``(git push origin 'main')`` hands the ref token ``'main')``,
    whose trailing ``)`` is unquoted. Returning early on the mere PRESENCE of a
    quote left that ``)`` in place, so the ref resolved to ``main)``, never
    equalled ``main``, and the protected push was allowed AND audited as a
    feature-branch push -- reopening the exact class this cut exists to close.
    Cutting only at operators outside quotes satisfies both readings at once.

    An UNBALANCED quote leaves the remainder read as quoted, so nothing is cut.
    That is safe because such a token is not executable as written: bash has an
    unterminated quote and never runs the push. If a later quote in the command
    balances it, the shell folds the span into one word whose ref likewise no
    longer equals a protected name.

    Quotes are PRESERVED in the result; both call sites remove them afterwards
    (see ``_dequote_token``), which is what keeps ``'(main)'`` a literal ref.

    Escapes are honoured through the shared walk, so ``ma\\)in`` keeps its

    ``rm -rf $'/'`` runs exactly what ``rm -rf /`` runs, and ``$'\\x2d\\x76'`` is
    ``-v``, so a matcher that has not resolved these is reading a spelling the
    shell never hands over.  An ANSI-C value is re-quoted with ``shlex.quote`` so a
    value containing whitespace or a quote stays ONE token through ``shlex.split``.

    ``$"…"`` is LOCALE TRANSLATION, and it is NOT ANSI-C -- measured, because
    treating the two alike was a bypass (BLOCKING from the GPT 5.6 lane).  Bash
    gives ``$"\\r\\mAA"`` the word ``\\r\\mAA``, byte-identical to plain
    ``"\\r\\mAA"``: inside double quotes a backslash escapes only ``$``, `````,
    ``"``, ``\\`` and a newline, so ``\\r`` is a literal backslash-r and NOT a
    carriage return.  Decoding it as ANSI-C turned that ``\\r`` into whitespace and
    the command vanished from the view, while the inner shell of
    ``bash -c $"\\r\\m -rf /"`` resolves the backslashes in its OWN lexing pass and
    runs the destructive command (measured: it executes ``rmAA`` for
    ``bash -c $"\\r\\mAA"``).  So the ``$`` is dropped and the double-quoted text is
    left for ``shlex`` to resolve by double-quote rules -- which also keeps
    ``rm -rf $"/"`` reaching the rule, since bash's operand there is ``/``.
