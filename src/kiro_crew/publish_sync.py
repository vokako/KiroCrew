"""Publish sync engine — provider-agnostic orchestration.

Combines the pure data layer (``artifacts.ArtifactStore`` — reads/writes the
``publication`` block) with a pluggable :class:`PublishProvider` (resolved via
``publication.provider``, the registry default provider). This is the only module
that touches both the store and a provider.

Responsibilities that live here (provider-agnostic):
- Rendering a KiroCrew artifact to ``(bytes-on-disk, content_type)`` — including
  wrapping ``widget`` artifacts in a standalone HTML document.
- The version-bump → push chokepoint and the 1:1 KiroCrew↔destination version
  invariant. Reverts mirror as a new version (never a pointer-rollback).
- Best-effort sync: a ``push_version`` failure NEVER fails the KiroCrew update;
  a genuine failure is recorded in ``publication.last_error`` and surfaced to
  the UI. A SUCCESSFUL publish whose link is not usable yet (e.g. CloudFront
  still rolling out) records that status on ``publication.notice`` instead —
  never ``last_error``, which every consumer reads as failure.
- Optimistic concurrency: the provider's concurrency token is stored in
  ``publication.last_pushed_sha256`` and passed back on the next push; a
  mismatch is surfaced as a conflict, never force-pushed.

Security (design §12): the publish path must not log artifact bytes. Content is
written to a temp file and handed to the provider by path; the temp file is
removed in a ``finally``. Artifact content is deliberately NOT redacted here —
the user is intentionally sharing it — but it is never written to a log.

    giving an owner one needs the positive absence probe tracked with the
    publication-existence contract.

    - ``NOTHING_PUBLISHED`` -- there is nothing to withdraw: the artifact was never
      published, or the destination it was bound to is CONFIRMED gone (a typed
      ``DriveNotFound``, never a string match on an error message). Delete proceeds.

      never attempted. The copy may still be served. Delete is REFUSED. This
      deliberately covers more cases than a narrower reading would, and the wider
      population is the accepted cost of not stranding copies silently.
    - ``WITHDRAWN`` -- the destination confirmed the removal. Delete proceeds.

    "Clone locally": bring a remote artifact I can access down to this device.
    The local copy links to the SAME remote copy via a ``publication`` — I pull
    collaborators' edits down, and my snapshots push back up.

    ``auto_sync`` is the user's INTENT to keep the two copies in sync; a clone
    always turns it on (cloning is a deliberate two-way link), and it is never
    set or cleared by permission. Whether a given snapshot actually writes back
    is the publishing provider's call at push time: ``push_version`` attempts the
    push and the provider allows or denies it. So permission is evaluated live on
    every push — a grant or revoke over time is honoured automatically, with no
    permission verdict frozen at clone time. (A read of the remote's sharing can
    prove I *can* write, but never that I *can't*: edit rights may come via a
    group we can't resolve locally, so we never pre-disable a push from a read.)
    A denied push records a clear ``last_error`` and leaves the edits local;
    Fork is the path for a copy you intend to diverge from rather than sync with.
