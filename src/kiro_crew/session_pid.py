    failed to reap our agent (``killpg`` misses children in other process
    groups; a mid-init crash can race the descendant scan in ``_kill_process``),

       Linux-only, fail-closed elsewhere). The marker is only ever injected
       into environments Kiro Crew itself spawns (sandbox wrapper, ACP client

       LEADER being gone (:func:`_work_orphan_session_leader_alive`). Kiro

       be polling its output (a backgrounded test run, for instance) and is

    *child_map* is a SNAPSHOT, and it is reused across every candidate root in

    process and is dropped with its subtree. The PPid and the start token come
    from ONE ``stat`` read (:func:`_pid_parent_and_token`) so they cannot
    describe two different processes.

    Iterative, not recursive: an orphan chain deeper than Python's recursion
    limit would raise ``RecursionError``, which the caller's ``except`` clause
    does not name and which fires BEFORE the root is signalled -- aborting the

    Single-tree convenience: builds the parent->child map with one
    ``/proc/*/stat`` scan (see ``_build_child_map``) and delegates to
    ``_rss_mb_from_tree``. To measure MANY trees in one sweep, build the map
    once with ``_build_child_map()`` and call ``_rss_mb_from_tree()`` per tree so
    ``/proc`` is scanned only once, not once per tree.

    Any PID in *exclude_pids* is skipped along with the entire subtree beneath
    it — a defensive barrier so a caller can exclude a shared sub-tree (e.g. a
    pooled backend). Resident pages are summed and converted to MiB once at the
    end, so the reading is not biased downward by per-PID truncation.

    *proc_root* overrides the ``/proc`` mount (test seam only).

    Linux reads ``/proc``. Windows has neither ``/proc`` nor a safe parent->child
    walk (see ``_build_child_map``), so it delegates to
    ``platform_compat.proc_rss_tree_mb_for_pid``, which sums only
    lineage-validated descendants; without that the ceiling measured every tree
    as 0 MiB there and no session was ever recycled. macOS has no ctypes-only
    per-pid RSS path, so it returns 0 and the ceiling stays inert.

    *exclude_pids* is honoured on the ``/proc`` route. The Windows route derives
    its own validated descendant set, so a caller that needs a subtree barrier
    there must exclude the pid before calling.
