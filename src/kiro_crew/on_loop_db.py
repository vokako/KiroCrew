"""Reusable runtime guard for on-loop SQLite access in the store layer.

The gateway runs one asyncio event loop. A blocking SQLite call made ON that
loop stalls every session's turn while it waits, and a stall held past
``dashboard.loop_stall_exit_after_secs`` (25s) makes the watchdog kill the
process and drop every in-flight turn in every channel.

``scripts/check_sync_io_in_async.py`` catches that defect only where it is
written *lexically* inside an ``async def``. It cannot see the same call one
frame down -- an ``async def`` that calls a plain synchronous helper which runs
the query -- and no name-based AST scan can, without whole-program type
inference. Closing that interprocedural half needs the check at the store's
connection accessor, where it fires for every caller
regardless of how deep in the stack the call sits.

Adopting the guard in a store is two lines: build one MODULE-LEVEL
:class:`OnLoopDBGuard` and call :meth:`OnLoopDBGuard.check` at the top of the
connection accessor. Module-level is load-bearing, not a style preference:
each guard owns a ``ContextVar``, and CPython never collects a ``ContextVar``
that any ``Context`` has seen, so building guards per short-lived object
would leak them.

``history.py`` keeps its own guard rather than adopting this one. Its
:class:`~kiro_crew.history.OnLoopPersistError` subclasses ``AssertionError``,
a semantic this module deliberately does not reproduce (see
:class:`OnLoopStoreError`), and that must not change. History's
``ContextVar`` opt-out IS mirrored here -- as the per-instance
:meth:`OnLoopDBGuard.allow_on_loop` -- but scoped per guard rather than
module-wide, so one store's vetted take cannot mute another's diagnostic;
the two guards stay separate because their error taxonomies and strictness
switches differ, not because the opt-out does.

A NOTE ON THE STRICTNESS SWITCH, because it is the subtle part. "Strict" means
"this surface is fully offloaded, so enforce it". That is a property of a
SURFACE, not of the process, and two surfaces can be at different stages of the
same cleanup. ``KIROCREW_STRICT_ON_LOOP_PERSIST`` is already exported into the
e2e gateway by ``setup.py``'s ``test_e2e`` and ``.github/workflows/ci.yml``,
scoped when it was added to history's clean surface. A store still carrying
known un-offloaded on-loop callers must therefore NOT be armed by that flag, or
arming history's discipline reds an unrelated gate. Hence ``strict_env``: one
parser, one spelling of the truthy/falsy rules, one switch per surface.
