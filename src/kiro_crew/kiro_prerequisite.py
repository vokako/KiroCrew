"""Cross-platform Kiro CLI readiness detection.

The public KiroCrew provider is KiroACP-only, so a healthy, authenticated
``kiro-cli`` is a hard runtime prerequisite. This module's job is to answer one
question about the gateway host: **is there a Kiro CLI that runs, and is it
signed in?** It answers that by running the CLI's own read-only probes
(``--version``, then ``whoami``) inside the OS sandbox.

**It performs no setup of its own.** Both setup steps belong to Kiro CLI and are
taken by the user:

* obtaining the CLI — from Kiro's official setup page
  (:data:`OFFICIAL_INSTALL_DOCS_URL`);
* signing in — ``kiro-cli login`` (:data:`KIRO_CLI_LOGIN_COMMAND`), run by the
  user wherever they already use the CLI.

Kiro Crew neither installs nor authenticates on the user's behalf, so there is no
installer download, no installer execution, and no device-flow spawn. The
reasons are the same in both cases: the vendor's own tooling does it better and
stays correct as it changes, owning it here meant owning a large privileged
surface (a remote shell script executed unsandboxed; a credential-writing child
process), and every copy of that logic on this side was one more thing to drift
out of date — the installer's pinned digest silently broke setup on any upstream
change.

What remains is detection, and detection alone: every subprocess this module
spawns is one of the two read-only probes above, sandboxed, with a fixed argv.
No command, argument, URL, or filesystem target is accepted from an HTTP
request, and the dashboard exposes only a ``status`` read plus the agent-spec
repair write (which touches Kiro Crew's own files, never the CLI).

# on a fixed ``whoami`` argv. It is kept OUT of :data:`_PROBE_ENV_KEYS` because
# ``--version`` is the FIRST execution of a candidate that has not yet answered
# anything, and nothing about resolving a version needs a key.
#
# The CLI's exit status reports which credential kind is CONFIGURED, not whether
# the credential is accepted, so a stale or mistyped key reads as signed in. That
# is the same answer an ACP session acts on, which is the point — but it means
# presence of this variable must never become a shortcut that skips the probe.
#
# In a post-scrub Docker container the variable lives only in the data home's

# gate latches unauthenticated on a host where sign-in actually works. Both
# case spellings are listed because matching is exact on POSIX and the HTTP
# stacks disagree on which case they honour (curl-family reads the lowercase

# reproduces the bug on half of hosts. ALL_PROXY is included deliberately: a
# SOCKS-only host sets it INSTEAD of the scheme-specific pair, and curl and
# reqwest both honour it as the fallback, so omitting it keeps the exact same
# defect for that host class.
#
# These are kept OUT of :data:`_PROBE_ENV_KEYS` for the same reason as the
# credential above: a proxy URL can embed credentials, and ``--version`` is
# the FIRST execution of a candidate that has not yet answered anything — and
# nothing about resolving a version needs the network. ``whoami`` runs only

    Every platform resolves among FIXED, home-anchored locations, drawn from the
    same set as the trusted live-store list in
    ``dashboard/handlers/kiro_usage_api.py`` (``_CLI_SQLITE_DBS``). No
    environment variable is consulted -- not ``XDG_DATA_HOME`` on Linux, not
    ``APPDATA`` or ``LOCALAPPDATA`` on Windows -- because the fence that makes
    this store unwritable by agent file tools (``_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS``) is
    anchored at exactly these paths. A redirected location either resolves to the
    same place or falls OUTSIDE the fence, where an agent can author the rows
    this function reads: it could then forge an identity that keeps matching and
    the children signed in as the previous account would never be retired. A
    fixed anchor cannot be pointed at something the agent may write.

    On Windows current kiro-cli writes its store under the local app-data
    directory (``AppData/Local/kiro-cli``); older layouts used the roaming one
    (``AppData/Roaming/kiro-cli``). When only one store exists it is chosen;
    when both exist the most recently written one wins, so a leftover from
    the other layout never masks the live store's account (the WAL-aware
    mtime tie-break lives in :func:`identity_stores.selected_store`). Both
    anchors sit inside the
    ``_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`` fence, so neither choice widens what an agent
    can forge. This branch stats the filesystem, so callers on the event loop
    should resolve the path inside the same worker thread as the read itself.

    The cost is that a host which relocates its data home is read as having no
    identity, so the change is reported as "absent" -- which errs toward retiring
    children, never toward trusting them. ``environ`` is kept in the signature so
    callers need not know which platforms consult it, and so a future platform
    that genuinely requires it does not change every call site.

    :func:`kiro_identity_store_path` deliberately reads a FIXED path, because the

    redirected path can land outside it. But refusing to follow the redirection is
    not the same as being safe: if the environment points the CLI elsewhere and a
    LEFTOVER database still sits at the default location, reading it yields a
    confident fingerprint of an account nobody is signed into. A logout in the real
    store would then change nothing we can see, and the old-account child would be
    reused -- strictly worse than reporting "cannot tell".

    So a configured relocation is reported here, and the caller treats it as
    absent: no read, no false confidence, and the absent path already means "never
    reconciled, re-sweep every turn".

    Both variables count, unconditionally. The live store's directory is
    resolved by the CLI from ``LOCALAPPDATA`` (current layout) or ``APPDATA``
    (legacy layout), and which generation is writing cannot be observed --
    so once EITHER variable is redirected, a database at a fixed anchor
    cannot be attributed to a live writer: it may be the live store of the
    other generation, or a leftover of either, and reading a leftover yields
    a confident fingerprint of an account nobody is signed into. Refusing to
    guess errs toward absent, the module's safe side. The cost is that a
    host with Group-Policy folder redirection (which targets Roaming)
    reports absent even when a current-layout Local store is healthy -- the
    same answer such hosts got when the anchor lived under Roaming, so the
    posture is status quo there, and the once-per-service log in
    :meth:`KiroPrerequisiteService.current_identity_fingerprint` makes it
    diagnosable. A variable set to exactly the default location is not a

    absent at runtime. The spec looks accepted while the session lacks the tools it
    declares — the same silent shape this probe exists to remove, reached through a

    A server is launchable with EITHER a stdio ``command`` or a remote ``url``,

    (stdio) or 'url' (remote)"). Treating a URL-only entry as unlaunchable would be

    discard the user's MCP tool selections.

    Structural only, and narrow on purpose: it reports an entry that names no
    transport whatsoever, or is not an object. It does not judge whether a command
    resolves or a URL answers — those are runtime questions with a different answer
    per host, and they belong to the binary.

    Fails open on an unreadable, oversized or non-JSON file: each is a different
    fault with its own reporting, and guessing here would put a second card on one
    problem. The read goes through the module's bounded helper rather than
    ``read_text`` so a pathologically large spec cannot pull the gateway into an
    OOM through the readiness probe.

        Kiro Crew launches every session as ``kiro-cli acp ...`` (see

        runs fine and signs in fine, then fails at session-create with an opaque

        exits 0 and prints its help, one that lacks it exits nonzero with an
        "unknown subcommand" line (kiro-cli is a clap CLI).

        The verdict is deliberately conservative in ONE direction. A timeout, a

        rejection is treated as SUPPORTED, so a probe that merely failed to run

        session-create with the pre-existing error, i.e. no worse than before this
        check existed, whereas a false positive would strand a healthy install.
