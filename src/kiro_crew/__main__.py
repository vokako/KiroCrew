"""Entry point for ``python -m kiro_crew``.

``_ensure_ssl_certs()`` MUST run before ``from kiro_crew.cli import main``
because importing ``cli`` can still reach ``aiohttp`` transitively (e.g. via
``cli_doctor`` → ``dashboard.crash_dump_store`` / ``dashboard.origin``).
cli.py's heaviest aiohttp edges (``cli_server``, ``dashboard.state``) are
deferred to call time, which makes this ordering EASIER to hold —
but any module-scope import that reaches aiohttp, now or later, must still
execute after ``_ensure_ssl_certs()``, so the prelude stays mandatory.

aiohttp caches its default SSL context at import time
(``aiohttp.connector._SSL_CONTEXT_VERIFIED``).  On AL2 / dev-desktops the
BrazilPython cafile is missing, so the cached context ends up with zero CA
certs and every HTTPS connection fails with CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED.
