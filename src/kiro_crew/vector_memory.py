    a type error and mypy cannot flag it. :meth:`__bool__` closes exactly that hole:
    ``bool(result)`` is ``wrote``, byte-for-byte the
    predicate those callers are written against. So there is one method, one

    ``A — NOT: B`` is either rule ``A`` with clause ``B``, or a bare rule whose text

        Called TWICE by :meth:`init` -- once before the connect and once after -- and
        the ordering is the point of the first call. The owner-only directory does not
        cover a file that already EXISTS on Windows, because Bypass Traverse Checking
        is granted to Everyone by default, so a permissive DACL on the file itself
        stays reachable inside a tightened directory. Restricting before
        ``sqlite3.connect`` means the migrations do not run against a file another
        local user can still write; restricting again after covers whatever SQLite
        just created.

        Missing files are skipped BY AN EXISTENCE CHECK, not by catching the failure:
        on Windows ``restrict_to_owner`` raises plain ``OSError`` for a missing path
        (the in-process DACL write's failure is translated to ``OSError``) rather
        than ``FileNotFoundError``, which only ever comes from the POSIX
        ``os.chmod``. Catching alone would log a false "may be readable by other
        users" warning for each missing file, twice per init. The race between
        the check and the call is benign: a file that appears in between is created by
        SQLite or FAISS inside the already-tightened directory, so it inherits
        owner-only access on both platforms and the next init covers it regardless.

        Any other failure warns rather than raising -- memory being unavailable is a
        supported degraded state, and ``restrict_to_owner`` documents this
        warn-and-continue handler as its caller contract.

        Returns which outcome occurred (see :class:`LessonWriteOutcome`) rather than a
        bare ``bool``, whose ``False`` conflated "validation refused this", "a dedup
        rule claimed it", "it is already stored exactly as submitted" and "your bare
        re-submit kept the stored clause" -- four facts a caller cannot act on without
        telling them apart. The result's TRUTH VALUE is still the old predicate (see
        :class:`LessonWriteResult`), so a caller that only needs "did this write
        something" keeps using ``if store.write_lesson(...)`` unchanged.

        Deduplicates against existing lessons:
        - Substring match: if existing contains new (or vice versa), longer wins
        - Topic overlap: if >50% of significant words match, newer replaces older
        - Semantic similarity: if >85% cosine similarity, longer wins

        Two of those three rules DELETE a stored lesson, and the "longer wins" tie
        break means a submitted rule can retire a stored one that is more general
        than it -- attaching a condition to a rule makes the text longer and the
        guidance NARROWER, so the row that survives can be the one that applies less
        often. That is the designed behaviour and this method keeps it: the
        alternative is a store that accumulates near-identical rules, which is what
        these three rules exist to prevent, and the onboarding import already shows
        the sanctioned way to opt out of it (route to ``set_semantic_if_absent``,
        which cannot replace anything -- see ``onboarding_import``).

        What it does NOT keep is the silence. Every rule that deletes records the
        rule text it removed in :attr:`LessonWriteResult.superseded`, so a caller is
        never handed a bare ``inserted`` for a call that destroyed a lesson the
        user still wanted. The result is the only place that can carry this: the
        deleted row is a tombstone, so it is gone from ``get_lessons``, from
        ``learn_list`` and from the injected lessons block by the time the caller
        looks.

        Pass ``rule_emb`` to reuse an embedding already computed by the caller
        and avoid a second blocking embed of the identical text. A caller doing
        that MUST also read :attr:`space_generation` BEFORE it embeds and pass it
        as ``rule_emb_generation``, so a model swap landing between that embed and
        this write is detected and the vector is left NULL for the backfill

        most of the original cost. ``_sqlite_vector_search`` already normalizes
        its query once for the same reason; this is the lesson-path equivalent.

        Stored lesson vectors are un-normalized by contract (see

        band that may include non-positive bounds needs the true value. The
        numpy path promotes both operands to float64 before the norm and the
        dot product: the stored blob is float32 on disk, and accumulating a
        many-dimensional norm/dot in float32 lands ~1e-7 away from the plain
        ``_cosine_sim`` this scorer replaces — irrelevant when only sorting,

        of continuous inference — and to a user that is indistinguishable from a
        runaway process. ``memory.embedding_bulk_duty`` spreads the same total
        work over more wall time by idling between rows (see
        :func:`kiro_crew.embeddings.bulk_pace_delay`).

        The sleep is HERE, on the sweep's own thread, and holds neither the DB
        lock nor the model: an interactive embed arriving mid-pause is served
        immediately. It also deliberately covers a row that failed to embed —
        the delay is derived from measured elapsed time, so a no-op returns 0.0
        and only real work is paced.

        The pause falls between this row's inference and its write, which is what
        makes it safe to interrupt: a sweep killed mid-pause leaves the row's
        ``embedding`` NULL and the next sweep re-embeds it, exactly as it already

        a progress bar on; slowing that down would be paying the cost with none
        of the benefit, since the load is expected in that case.

        *pace* therefore also selects the scheduling class, because attendance —
        not corpus size — is what both dials are really keyed on. An unattended
        sweep embeds at ``PRIORITY_BULK``, which is what gives it the reduced
        ``memory.embedding_bulk_threads`` pool; an attended one embeds at
        ``PRIORITY_NORMAL`` and so keeps the full interactive pool. Without this,

        Concurrency: this is a SYNCHRONOUS method. The factory call and probe
        perform blocking model inference (or a model load on first call),
        so this method MUST be invoked from a sync context (worker thread, sync
        handler, etc.). Callers reaching this from an async event loop should
        wrap the call in `asyncio.to_thread()` to avoid stalling the loop. Async
        callers (history consolidation, dashboard memory handlers) MUST offload
        via `asyncio.to_thread()`; the sync paths (add_memory, inject, recall)
        call directly. The rebind block is serialized by `_embed_fn_rebind_lock`
        so concurrent writers share at most one factory call + probe per cooldown
        window.

        Stored vectors are only comparable to each other when they came from the

        produced them, swapping the embedding model corrupts search
        silently: with a different dim the old rows are quietly dropped from the
        index, and with the SAME dim (any other 1024-d model) stale vectors are
        cosine-scored against new-model queries and return meaningless
        similarities.

        This records the active vector space in ``memory_meta`` and, when it
        changes, clears every stored embedding to NULL and drops the FAISS index.
        That deliberately reuses the existing NULL-embedding machinery instead of
        adding a parallel one: :meth:`backfill_missing_embeddings` already
        re-embeds NULL episodic rows in batches and now repairs NULL lesson rows
        alongside them, ``build_faiss_index`` and ``_sqlite_vector_search``
        already skip NULL rows, and FTS keyword search is
        unaffected — so search stays correct (just keyword-only for the affected
        rows) while the re-embed proceeds, and an interrupted run is simply
        resumed by the next sweep.

        The first call on a pre-existing database has no recorded space to compare
        against, and what to do then depends on whether the caller can ATTRIBUTE
        those vectors:

        - ``clear_when_unknown=False`` (default) — the active space is the one
          that produced them (the bundled model), so stamp the signature and
          change nothing. A plain upgrade must not force every user to re-embed
          their whole memory.
        - ``clear_when_unknown=True`` — the caller knows the active space did NOT
          produce them, so they are foreign and get cleared. Callers decide this
          by comparing the active signature against the bundled model's
          (``embeddings.default_embedding_space_signature``), which is provable:
          un-versioned vectors predate custom-model support, so the bundled model
          is the only thing that could have written them. Deciding it that way
          rather than by "is a custom model configured?" covers a model selected
          by config, by env var, or by a programmatic
          ``register_embedding_backend`` alike. Without this the common upgrade
          order — stop, update, point ``embed_model_path`` at a model, start —
          would stamp the NEW signature onto bundled-model vectors and they would
          never be re-embedded.

        A signature that already matches is a no-op regardless of
        ``clear_when_unknown``, so a custom-model host does not re-clear on

        the onboarding importer. Once the model is present and ``embed_fn`` is

        become semantically searchable.

        Rows cleared by :meth:`reconcile_embedding_space` after an embedding-model

        Synchronous + blocking (runs model inference) — call from a worker thread
        / executor, never directly on the event loop.

        FAISS is NOT required. It is an optional accelerator and not a declared
        dependency, so gating on it made this sweep a silent no-op on a stock
        install — every deferred row stayed NULL forever. ``search_episodic``
        already falls back to ``_sqlite_vector_search`` (a stdlib cosine scan

        *pace* (default on) idles between rows so the sweep targets
        ``memory.embedding_bulk_duty`` of wall time — the same total CPU work
        spread thinner, which is what keeps an unattended post-migration sweep
        from pinning several cores for tens of minutes. It is a target rather
        than a ceiling: a single row whose inference is slow enough to ask for
        more than :data:`~kiro_crew.embeddings._MAX_BULK_PACE_SLEEP` of idle is
        capped there, so that row runs at a higher effective duty. Pass
