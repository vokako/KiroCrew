"""The builtin channel roster — the ONE place that knows every channel.

Adding a builtin channel = add its descriptor to :func:`builtin_channel_descriptors`.
That is the "one required edit" the channel-plugin RFC's seam collapse promises
(plus, for now, an icon and i18n keys on the frontend — measured in PR ③'s
seam audit as irreducible until the frontend registry endpoint lands).

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (and why the list is not in ``messaging/registry.py``):
``messaging/`` must never import a channel package — the dependency direction
``<channel> -> messaging`` is pinned in ``messaging/dispatch.py`` and is what
keeps the shared pipeline reusable. But SOMETHING has to import all the
channels to enumerate them. This module is that something: it sits above both
sides and is imported only by hosts (the gateway, dashboard handlers), never
by ``messaging/`` or by any channel package.

Imports are at MODULE scope on purpose: channel modules pull in their vendor
clients, and this module is imported by hosts (``slack/gateway.py``) at
process import time — BEFORE any event loop starts. That keeps every channel's
dependency graph loading at host import time. Lazy in-function imports
here would instead run those dependency graphs synchronously on the live
gateway loop the first time ``_start_channel_transports()`` enumerates the
roster, stalling the dashboard mid-boot. Executor-side callers such as
``_channel_members()`` still import this module lazily on their side, which
stays correct either way.

Slack's descriptor carries ``start=None``: it is governed like every other
member, but its socket-client lifecycle is host-managed in ``_connect_slack``
(a governance deny must drop the client, not merely skip a start call), and it
deliberately connects AFTER the other channels — same boot order as before.
