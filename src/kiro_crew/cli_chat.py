_CLI_SESSION_KEY = "cli_chat"

#: The ACP runtime's canonical identity when no agent is configured.  The

#: because the CLI relied on the provider's default.

_UNVERIFIED_SHELL_CODE = "unverified_shell"
#: The authorization gate itself could not produce a verdict. A broken gate is
#: not permission to run, so the request is refused and answered under its own
#: code rather than being left pending.
_GATE_FAILURE_CODE = "gate_failed"

#: operator could not reliably see and answer is a denial, never implicit consent.
_PROMPT_FAILURE_CODE = "prompt_failed"

_ABORTED_CODE = "session_aborted"

#: said yes, and an audit reader must not read this as a human refusal.

    records. The canonical ``@server/tool`` reference carries both halves. It is
    used in preference to an ``mcp__server__tool`` composition because that form
    re-splits on the last ``__``, so a server or tool name containing ``__``
    collapses two distinct identities onto one string.
