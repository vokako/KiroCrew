    The families are kept apart because the sigils are not interchangeable:
    GitHub draws pull requests and issues from ONE number sequence (``#4411``,
    ``/pull/4411`` and ``/issues/4411`` are the same item), while GitLab numbers
    merge requests separately from issues, which is why it spells them ``!12``
    and ``#12``. For a SIGIL query that separation is a guarantee — ``!12`` never
    matches ``#12``, a different object. A sigil-free query ("merge request 12")
    also carries the bare digits, which a ``#12`` mention satisfies, so there the
    separation governs ranking rather than exclusion.

    Path spellings carry no leading slash so they match both ``/pull/4411`` in a
    URL and a bare ``pull/4411`` written on its own.

    The prose spellings ("pr 4411", "pull request 4411", "pr4411") are included
    because a transcript often names the item in words rather than with a sigil,
    and a query that typed the sigil should still find it. They match as plain
    substrings, so a glued form can hit inside a longer word (``expr4411``
    satisfies ``pr4411``). That is deliberate: this module matches every other
    needle as a substring — ``cont`` hits ``contention`` — and adding word
    boundaries for some spellings and not others would make the rule harder to
    predict than the false positive it avoids, which ranks last anyway on a
    single hit. The digit boundary still bounds the numeric side.

    A bare digit spelling is a substring of its own sigil and glued spellings, so
    one mention of ``#4411`` counts twice inside a bare reference's needle. That
    only lifts the relevance score of a session that really does reference the
    item, and never gates.

    Plain digits are a spelling only for a ``bare`` reference, and that
    asymmetry is deliberate. A query that typed no sigil ("issue 42") is looking
    for the number as written, so the digits belong; a query that typed one
    ("#4411", a PR URL) was explicit, and admitting bare digits there would make
    ``!12`` match every session that mentions a standalone 12 — ordinary prose
    (a count, a date, a version).

    Recall relative to the plain substring gate this replaces does not rest on
    the list being exhaustive by inspection — three shapes slipped past that
    reasoning — but on a property test that drives every shape the parser
    accepts against a transcript quoting it verbatim. Concretely: a sigil shape
    contains its own canonical spelling (``owner/repo2#4411`` contains
    ``#4411``), a path or URL shape contains a path spelling, and a glued or
    two-token shape contains the bare digits. The one session the expansion can
    still drop is one whose only claim to the old match was the digits sitting
    INSIDE a longer number ("4411" within run id 1544110293) — and excluding that
    is the point of the digit boundary, since such a session never referenced
    the item.

    because the failure is SILENT — :func:`parse_search_query` casefolds its input
    and :func:`count_needle` requires already-folded needles, so a spelling that
    arrives with a capital letter produces a needle that matches nothing, with no
    error and no log; it just returns zero results.

    Every way a resolver can fail is contained, because a plugin defect must not
    make the search box stop working: raising when CALLED, returning a malformed
    answer, and raising while its ``alts`` are READ — the hook promises a
    ``Sequence``, which cannot do that, but a resolver ignoring the contract can,
    so the read sits inside a ``try`` and the answer is dropped whole. Every case
    logs — a traceback where an exception was raised, the offending value where a
    shape was merely wrong. None of them is silent: silence is the defect above.

def parse_search_query(query: str) -> tuple[list[SearchNeedle], str, bool]:
    """Return ``(needles, phrase, adjacency_floor)`` for a search *query*, casefolded.

    ``phrase`` is the whole normalized query. ``needles`` are derived from the
    DISTINCT whitespace-separated terms in first-seen order; every caller that
    matches (:meth:`ConversationLog.search_sessions`) or locates
    (:func:`snippet_needles` for the snippet builders) query text derives from
    this one parse so the halves of a query cannot drift apart.

    Non-CJK terms become one required, weight-1.0 needle each — the classic
    substring-AND behavior (``"cont"`` hits ``"contention"``). A run of CJK
    characters cannot keep that rule: CJK text is written without spaces, so
    requiring the run verbatim demands the user's exact sentence and a
    multi-word query like ``"修复内存泄漏"`` would only ever match transcripts
    containing that literal string. Each CJK run therefore expands to:

    * its individual characters as REQUIRED needles at :data:`_CJK_CHAR_WEIGHT`
      — maximal recall, since a document discussing all the query's words
      contains all of its characters regardless of word order; and
    * its overlapping character bigrams as ADJACENCY needles at weight 1.0 —
      the standard dictionary-free CJK adjacency signal. They are not
      individually required, but when a query carries any, a session must hit
      AT LEAST ONE to qualify (see :meth:`ConversationLog.search_sessions`):
      individual han/kana characters are so common that a pure character
      scatter is noise, so the adjacency floor keeps the character gate's
      recall (words apart still match — each word IS a bigram hit) without
      letting scatter-only sessions fill the result page. Each occurrence also
      scores, so documents keeping more of the query adjacent rank higher.
      A single-character run stays one required, weight-1.0 needle: it IS the
      whole term.

    Precision moves from the gate into the ranking, which is the module's
    existing philosophy for the substring-prefix looseness on ASCII terms.

    A term that names a FORGE ITEM — a pull request, merge request or issue —
    becomes ONE required needle carrying every spelling of that item instead of
    the literal term (see :func:`_parse_forge_ref`). ``#4411``, ``pr 4411``,
    ``pull/4411``, a full PR URL and ``owner/repo#4411`` therefore all find the
    same sessions, whichever form each transcript happens to use, and the
    spellings are digit-bounded so ``#4411`` never matches ``#44110``. A naming
    word that introduces a number ("PR 4411") is dropped from the gate: it is
    not part of the reference, and requiring the letters "pr" would disqualify a
    transcript that names the pull request only by URL. When the query spelled
    the number with no sigil, plain digits stay one of the spellings, so the
    expansion keeps the recall of the literal AND it replaces — the one session
    it can drop is a session whose digits merely sat inside a longer number,
    which is what the digit boundary is for. Only a run of words that actually
    NAMES a type makes a following number a reference: "requests 12" and
    "merge 1234" stay literal terms, since dropping such a word from the gate
    would trade a real term for every session mentioning that number. A BARE
    number with no naming word at all is not a reference either: it keeps its
    plain substring needle, so numeric content search is unchanged, and gains
    the spellings as scoring-only needles, so the session that actually
    references pull request 4411 outranks one that merely contains those digits
    inside a run id.

    Bounds (both exist because **every needle costs one full scan** of a
    session's text): required needles cap at :data:`SEARCH_MAX_TOKENS` and
    scoring extras at :data:`_SEARCH_MAX_SCORING_EXTRAS`. Deduplication is free
    correctness — a repeated term cannot change an AND match. Truncation in
    EITHER set makes the query only LOOSER — fewer required terms, and a
    truncated adjacency set additionally WAIVES the adjacency floor (the third
    tuple element comes back ``False``), because enforcing "at least one bigram
    hit" against a partial bigram set would EXCLUDE a session that matches only
    a dropped bigram — turning a cost cap into a hidden gate for exactly the
    long spaceless queries this parse exists to serve. Looser can admit extra
    results but never hide a session that would have matched — the safe
    direction when the alternative is a keystroke-driven search stalling for
    seconds.

    A whitespace-only query yields ``([], "", False)``; callers treat that as
    "matches nothing" rather than "matches everything".

        This is the ONE ranking every transcript-search consumer shares — the
        dashboard history filter, the ``search_chat_history`` MCP tool, and
        Discord session resume — so the recency weighting and CJK adjacency
        floor below apply to all of them by design: "the best match for this
        query" should not depend on which surface asked.

        The query is parsed by :func:`parse_search_query` into needles, and a
        session matches only when **every** REQUIRED needle appears somewhere in
        its title or content — an AND over the whole document, not a single
        whole-query substring. That is what makes a natural multi-word query
        work: ``"ack contention hypotheses"`` finds a session discussing all
        three, which a whole-phrase match missed because those exact words never
        sit adjacent. A single-token query is unchanged by this — one token IS
        the phrase. CJK terms gate on their individual characters (CJK text has
        no spaces to split on, so the run itself would demand the user's exact
        sentence), rank on their character bigrams, and require at least one
        bigram hit (the adjacency floor) — see :func:`parse_search_query` for
        the recall/precision split.

        A term naming a forge item (``#4411``, ``pr 4411``, ``pull/4411``, a PR
        URL, ``owner/repo#4411``) gates on ANY spelling of that item rather than
        on the literal term, so the session that discussed the pull request is
        found whichever form its transcript used. A bare number additionally
        RANKS on those spellings while still gating on the plain digits.

        Each needle is matched case-insensitively as a SUBSTRING (so ``"cont"``
        hits ``"contention"``, which keeps search-as-you-type responsive) using
        full Unicode case folding via :meth:`str.casefold` (so e.g. German ``ß``
        folds to ``ss``).  Matching only on parsed ``content`` avoids false
        positives from JSON structural elements (e.g. the word ``"user"``
        matching every ``"role": "user"`` line).

        Ranking (higher is better)::

            score = ((title_hits * _TITLE_BOOST)
                  + (content_hits / sqrt(1 + doc_chars / 1024))) * recency

        where ``*_hits`` sum the per-needle weighted counts, plus
        ``_PHRASE_BOOST`` per occurrence of the exact whole query when it
        carries more than a single needle. The phrase bonus rewards adjacency:
        at comparable term frequency, the session containing the words TOGETHER
        as typed ranks above one that merely mentions them far apart.  It is
        deliberately a bonus and not an override — a session repeating one term
        far more often still wins on raw term frequency, exactly as it already
        did for a single-token query.  (Saturating term frequency, BM25-style,
        would change that; it would also re-rank every existing single-token
        query, so it is out of scope here.)

        ``recency`` is a bounded multiplicative boost — ``1 +
        _RECENCY_MAX_BOOST / (1 + age_days / _RECENCY_HALF_WEIGHT_DAYS)`` — so
        at comparable relevance today's session outranks last year's, while a
        decisively better old match still wins (the boost tops out at ×2.5 and
        never drops below ×1).

        Title matches get a strong field boost - titles are short and
        intentional, so a hit there is strong evidence.  Content matches
        are normalized by a sqrt length factor so a long session with a
        casual mention doesn't outrank a short, focused one.  (Simpler
        than BM25's ``(1-b) + b*(dl/avgdl)`` because we avoid the
        two-pass scan needed for corpus stats.)  Sessions missing any
        required needle are dropped.  Ties break by recency (existing
        ``list_sessions`` order - newest first).  Caps results at *limit*.
        Only the ``_SEARCH_SCAN_WINDOW`` most recent files are scored, so
        I/O stays bounded even with hundreds of sessions.

        Returns ``None`` when the file could not be read, which the caller must
        distinguish from ``(0, "")`` (a session with no textual content): the
        former must not be cached.

        Reads the file via :meth:`_iter_message_texts` rather than going through
        :meth:`_read_messages`, for two reasons.

        Memory: that method memoizes the PARSED message dicts, and a search
        touches every session in the scan window, so routing the fold through it
        pins the whole corpus's parsed form in gateway RSS as a side effect of
        searching. On a 136 MB / 125-session corpus that is ~330 MB of parsed
        dicts versus ~37 MB for the folded strings this actually needs.

        Correctness: ``_msg_cache`` is filled by callers that do not hold this
        key's write lock, so an entry can be a pre-rewrite parse stored under a
        restored (unchanged) mtime. Folding from it would launder that staleness
        into the search cache, which the caller's lock cannot prevent. Reading
        the file makes the fold a function of the file alone.

        The caller holds ``_file_lock``, which orders this read against writers
        in THIS process — the lock table is class-level and path-keyed, so that
        includes writers using other ``ConversationLog`` instances. A writer in
        another process holds only the cross-process flock, so it can still
        interleave; if it bumps the mtime, the caller's pre-read stat leaves the
        cached mtime older than the file's and the next access re-folds. A
        cross-process PRESERVED-mtime rewrite, however, is caught by neither
        the lock nor the generation (the counter lives in this process) — a
        known residual gap shared with every memo in this class. *gen* is the
        invalidation-generation snapshot the caller took alongside its stat;
        the snippet store below publishes under it and records it in the entry,
        which is what lets a warm hit notice an in-process rewrite performed
        through a different instance (whose ``_invalidate_cache`` pops only its
        own instance's caches).

        Separated from :meth:`_folded_content` so the memoization is observable:
        a caller (or a test) can count how often the expensive fold actually
        runs, independent of how many queries were served.

        reading as one sentence when it actually spans two — consistent with
        :meth:`_folded_content`, where the ``\\x00`` join stops a match from
        bridging messages in the first place.

        Display-only and best effort: ``casefold`` is used for the search so it
        agrees with the hit detection in :meth:`search_sessions` (``.lower()``
        misses matches ``casefold`` finds, e.g. ``ß`` / ``İ``, which would yield
