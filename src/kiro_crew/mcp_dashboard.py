"""The dashboard-control MCP server — the agent's hands on the dashboard's own
organization surfaces.

Deliberately NOT part of ``kirocrew-core``. Core is the tool surface EVERY
session carries, and kiro-cli reads ``tools/list`` once per session, so anything
listed there spends context in every request of every session forever — whether
or not the user ever wants it. Reorganizing the sidebar is something a user asks
for on purpose, occasionally; it does not belong in the always-on surface.

So this is its own server, and it is an ASSIGNABLE SET: an agent gets these
tools when its own kiro spec carries both the ``mcpServers`` entry and the
matching ``@kirocrew-dashboard`` reference in ``tools`` — kiro-cli loads a server
only when something references it. The default agent's spec carries neither, so
a session on the default agent pays nothing for a capability it never uses, and
an agent that should reorganize the dashboard is granted it deliberately.

Assignment is per SERVER, not per tool: a spec that references this server gets
every tool in it. That is the unit to keep in mind when adding one — a capability
that must be grantable separately belongs in a server of its own.

What it controls today is the chat (sidebar) folder tree: read it, create a
folder, reparent a folder, and file a live session into one. Create and move
only — no delete and no rename, so nothing here can lose a conversation. Every
tool is a thin proxy over the dashboard's existing endpoints (loopback +
``X-Internal-Secret``); the endpoints keep owning every tree invariant, and the
gateway audits each write with the caller's declared component name — this
server's requests carry ``X-Internal-Caller: kirocrew-dashboard`` (attached
centrally by ``run_mcp_stdio_loop`` + the ``mcp_core`` request helpers), which
``chat_folders._audit_origin`` validates against its known-caller set — so the
log can tell an agent's move from the user's own, and from any future internal
caller's.

Why the set needs no second gate behind the assignment: these tools grant no
read the agent does not already have (``list_sessions`` in ``kirocrew-core`` is
always available and already returns every session's title and key), they cannot
delete a folder or a conversation, and the worst outcome is a sidebar the user
has to tidy. Contrast the keystone leaves in ``security.py``
(``computer_use.json``, ``browser-mode-enabled``, the Ops Mission Control mode):
each grants reach OUTSIDE Kiro Crew — desktop input synthesis, the operator's
logged-in browser, writes against production incident tooling — or is the
security floor itself, and each is therefore stored where the agent cannot write.

The rule that follows, and the reason the tool set is ratcheted in
``test_mcp_dashboard_registration.py``: a capability whose blast radius DOES
require authorization needs its own keystone leaf, and being merely unreferenced
in the default spec is not that. Session control (driving or stopping another
session) is that shape.

Identity posture: two resolvers, for two different jobs. The SEL invocation log
(``_call_tool``) uses the NON-strict resolver — that header is ATTRIBUTION, and
a lenient misattribution there is tolerable. Every decision that SCOPES what a
caller may see or verify-writes — ``_visible_chat_slots``,
``_refuse_tree_shaping_if_unverifiable``, and ``chat_folder_move_session``'s own
caller check (the one tool here that writes to a session other than the
caller's) — uses :func:`mcp_core._resolve_session_key_strict`, whose first
source is the gateway-injected per-call caller block — the only identity that
holds on a pooled backend serving many sessions (this server advertises
``kirocrew.caller-identity`` so gatewayd injects one; see
``ADVERTISE_CALLER_IDENTITY``). An unverifiable caller is refused by those
paths, never waved through on the lenient walk.

#: Whether this server advertises ``kirocrew.caller-identity`` — i.e. whether it
#: consumes the per-call caller block gatewayd injects instead of reading identity
#: from its own process. True here because it does: every scoping decision
#: (``_visible_chat_slots``, ``_refuse_tree_shaping_if_unverifiable``) resolves
#: the caller through :func:`mcp_core._resolve_session_key_strict`, whose first
#: source is that block.
#:
#: Advertising is not cosmetic. ``mcp_gateway/backend.py`` strips any client-forged
#: caller block from EVERY forwarded request and re-injects its own only when the
#: backend advertised this capability — so without the advertisement the block
#: never arrives, and this server's resolver reads an empty identity no matter how
#: correctly it is written. Nothing declines to POOL an unadvertised backend
#: (``rewriter.UNPOOLABLE_SERVERS`` is empty and documents that the capability is
#: read only to decide injection), so the unadvertised state was not "per-session
#: spawn" — it was pooled AND identity-blind. For this server that fail-closed
#: every scoped tool on a pooled backend: an unverifiable caller is refused, so
#: the tools stopped working for exactly the sessions pooling was built to serve.
#:
#: A module-level constant rather than a bare argument below so the value is
#: readable without executing :func:`run_mcp_server`, and so
#: ``test/test_mcp_managed_caller_identity.py`` can assert it against the argument
#: actually handed to the shim.
