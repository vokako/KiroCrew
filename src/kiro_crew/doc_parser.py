"""Document text extraction for .docx, .pdf, and .pptx files.

Uses stdlib zipfile plus a hardened XML parser (defusedxml) for .docx and
.pptx since these are ZIP archives containing XML.  PDF extraction uses
a best-effort binary text scan (no third-party deps required).

The XML comes from user-supplied uploads, so parsing goes through
defusedxml rather than the stdlib xml.etree parser: the stdlib one resolves
external entities, exposing an XXE (local-file disclosure / entity-expansion
DoS) on a crafted document. defusedxml.fromstring is a drop-in that rejects
DTDs and external entities.

All functions accept a file path and return extracted text as a string.
They never raise — on failure they return an empty string and log a warning.
