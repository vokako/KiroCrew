"""The shared work record between a conductor session and the workers it dispatched.

Three ledgers now carry that name, and they are not interchangeable.
:mod:`kiro_crew.session_ledger` is ONE session's own durable state. Issue Radar's
``crew_store`` is a per-repository work ledger keyed by a forge issue number. This
module is the third: a record two parties write and neither owns, so that a
conductor learns what a worker did as DATA instead of reading its transcript.

Storage only: no MCP tool, no HTTP route, no UI, and deliberately no importer
anywhere else in the tree, so it reverts by deleting this file and its test.

WRITER OWNERSHIP is the whole design, and it is expressed as two entry points rather
than one update function with a field allowlist:

  * :func:`apply_conductor_action` writes ``title``, ``acceptance``, ``state``,
    ``verdict``, ``decision``, ``worker_session_key``, ``round`` and ``fails``.
  * :func:`apply_worker_report` writes ``status``, ``summary``, ``artifacts``,
    ``pr`` and ``last_report_at``.

The two field sets are disjoint. Phase 2 mounts one tool on each, so a worker cannot
reach a conductor field because the function it can call takes no parameter that
names one — an absent parameter outlives an allowlist that must be kept correct as
fields are added. Phase 1 performs NO identity resolution; that is Phase 2's job at
the tool layer, and the split shape here is what lets it be done by construction.

LOCK ORDER, for the two paths that hold more than one lock. ``create`` enforces the
per-conductor item cap, which means reading the items directory, so it holds the
conductor lock across the whole transaction and takes the new item's lock from
inside that hold. ``bind`` holds the item lock and takes the worker's binding lock
from inside it, because "this worker holds no other open item" is a property of
the binding file, not of the item. So: **conductor -> item -> binding(worker)**.
No path anywhere takes any two of these in the other relative order, so the order
is total and two conductors cannot deadlock. Every other write takes exactly one
lock: the conductor lock for ``goal``, the item lock for ``decide``/``verdict``/
``close`` and for a worker report. File locks on fresh descriptors do NOT nest, so
each locked body has a ``_locked`` twin that a holder calls directly rather than
re-acquiring.

CAPS REFUSE, THEY DO NOT TRUNCATE. Every bound on a STORED field is validated
before the first write, so a refusal leaves every file byte-identical. A truncated
summary the worker believes landed whole is a silent loss the worker cannot detect.
The one bounded projection is the event line's ``text``: it is a 500-char excerpt of
a field the item record already holds in full, so clipping it loses nothing.

CORRUPTION READS AS ABSENT. A torn, truncated, non-UTF-8 or oversized record returns
``None`` rather than raising, matching :mod:`kiro_crew.session_ledger`'s treatment of
an oversized state file. A reader of a two-writer store must not be the thing that
crashes because the other writer was interrupted.
