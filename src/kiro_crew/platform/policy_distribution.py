"""Central distribution of the Level-1 governance ceiling.

An enterprise IT admin owns **one** ``security_policy.json`` and every machine in
the fleet follows it: each host fetches the document from a central location,
keeps the last-known-good copy on disk, and re-fetches on an interval so a pushed
change binds without a restart, a redeploy, or a visit to the host.  This module
is that engine.  ``governance.PolicyDistribution`` is the parsed declaration;
``governance.load_security_policy`` calls in here for the fetch tier.

Where the source comes from
---------------------------

Two channels, and the split is deliberate:

* ``KIROCREW_POLICY_URL`` (plus the ``KIROCREW_POLICY_*`` siblings below) — the
  **fleet lever**, the same role ``KIROCREW_SECURITY_POLICY`` already plays.  A
  config-management push (Jamf / Intune / Ansible / Chef / Puppet) sets one
  variable and the host is centrally governed with no file to place and no
  package to rebuild.  It also carries the per-machine request credential, which
  a published document must not.
* ``distribution`` inside a policy that some LOWER tier already supplies — the
  **self-refresh** channel.  A fleet places one small bootstrap policy once (or
  an edition bundles it), and that document names where its own successors come
  from.  This is what makes "push a change to every instance" a property of the
  policy rather than of whatever placed it.

The env channel wins per setting, so a host can be redirected or have its
refresh interval changed without editing a signed document.

Precedence, and why this tier sits where it does
------------------------------------------------

``load_security_policy`` resolves, highest first.  The top two tiers are
AUTHORITIES; every tier below one of them may only **tighten** it:

1. the **MDM-managed configuration profile** — root-owned, re-asserted by the
   device management system on every check-in.
2. **this tier** — the centrally-distributed document.
3. ``KIROCREW_SECURITY_POLICY`` — an explicit LOCAL file.
4. the companion-bundled resource.
5. ``<data-home>/security_policy.json``.
6. none → ungoverned.

Tiers 3–5 are mutually exclusive (first present wins among them) and collectively
form the *subordinate*, which intersects into the authority above it.  So this tier
now outranks ``KIROCREW_SECURITY_POLICY``, which it did not use to: while the env
file sat above the fetched document the enterprise ceiling was advisory — any
account that can set an environment variable could point it at a permissive file and
the fleet's ceiling never bound.  Tiers 4 and 5 sit below for the older reason,
unchanged: they are what the fetched document is *replacing*, and a fleet that ships
a bootstrap policy naming a source expects the source to win, or the bootstrap could
never be superseded.



Availability, and the one thing this must never do
--------------------------------------------------

A ceiling that a network can withhold is a ceiling that a network can also
*remove*, so the dispositions here are chosen around two failures that pull in
opposite directions:

* **The endpoint is unreachable.**  A cached last-known-good copy is served, and
  that is the normal answer — a host does not stop working because a bucket had a
  bad minute.  With no cache at all the host has no ceiling, and
  ``on_unavailable`` decides: ``fail_closed`` (the default) refuses to start,
  because a fleet that pointed a host at a central ceiling meant that ceiling to
  bind and "we could not tell" must not read as "run unbounded"; ``degrade``
  falls through to the next tier and records a governance incident.
* **The pushed document is bad.**  At boot there is nothing to fall back to, so a
  document that does not parse or does not verify fails like any other tier.
  **On a live refresh it is REJECTED and the running ceiling is kept** — a
  refresh validates a candidate through the same floor gates boot uses and only
  installs it if they all pass.  This is the asymmetry that keeps a typo from
  taking down a fleet that is already up.

Trust
-----

Fetched bytes are the tier where provenance matters most, and this module adds no
new trust root to establish it.  ``identity.signature`` is verified exactly as
for a file tier, against a key held in the operator-controlled admission policy —
never a key the fetched document supplies about itself.  The opt-in is that policy's
``require_policy_signature``, and this tier deliberately adds no per-tier flag of its
own: a document must not be the authority on whether it has to be authentic.  A
document that fails a mandated check is never cached, so a rejection does not persist
as a poisoned last-known-good.

The cache directory is on the ``security._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`` keystone, which
is load-bearing rather than tidy: the cache holds both the document AND the
recorded source it came from, so an agent able to write it could point its own
ceiling somewhere it controls and have the next boot honour it.

Transport
---------

``register_policy_fetcher`` is an append-only seam mirroring
``governance.register_scope`` — including its refusal to silently shadow a
built-in: a scheme maps to a callable, and re-registering one raises.  The built-ins are
``https``, ``file``, and ``http`` restricted to loopback hosts.  An edition that
needs request signing for its own object store, or a management channel that is
not HTTP at all, registers a fetcher at import time and changes nothing else —
the cache, the validation, the refresh loop and the dispositions are shared.

    The cache records WHICH source a copy came from so the repoint rule can refuse a

    does not need the plaintext — which matters because the URL may BE the credential: a
    pre-signed object-store link carries its signature in the query string, and this
    module's rule is that the source is emitted nowhere. Storing it in a file made the
    cache the one place that broke that rule, and the app backend reads that file.

    Not reversible in any useful sense: what an attacker would need is the signature, and
    that is an HMAC-SHA256 whose search space a preimage attempt cannot walk. An empty
    source digests to the empty string so "no source recorded" stays distinguishable from
    "recorded a source", rather than both hashing to the same constant.

    **The identity is what SELECTS the document, not what authenticates the request.** The
    fragment and the basic-auth PASSWORD are dropped (the username is not — it names the account,
    and two tenants at one host and path are two different documents), and so are the query parameters that carry a signature (see

    host that then hit a transient outage had no last-known-good, aborting startup under the
    fail-closed default. Nobody had to do anything for that; it was the credential doing what
    credentials do.

    Every OTHER query parameter stays in, because a query can also select the document:
    ``?policy=team-a`` and ``?policy=team-b`` are different sources, and treating them as one
    would let a repoint to a stricter policy keep serving the looser one — indefinitely on a

    lost the Windows rename retry) and document-before-metadata, so a process killed
    mid-write leaves either the previous consistent pair or a new document with old
    metadata — never metadata promising a document that is not there.
    ``restrict_to_owner`` also brings ``atomic_write``'s refusal to write through a
    symlinked parent, which matters more here than for an ordinary file: the parent
    is a trust root, and a link swapped in over it would redirect the write.

    The directory itself is created owner-only and INHERITABLY so, which is the
    control that actually matters — it holds the ceiling and the recorded source, so
    an agent able to write either could publish itself a ceiling with provenance.

    **Must not be called from the event loop.** ``replace_with_retry`` deliberately
    skips its Windows sharing-violation retry when it detects a running loop, so a
    write from there would lose it. Every caller today is boot (synchronous) or the
    refresher thread.

    Best-effort by design: a host that cannot write the cache is still governed by
    what it just fetched.  It simply has no outage fallback, which is worth a
    warning and not worth refusing to run.

    *expect_pair* makes the publish a **compare-and-swap**, checked inside the lock: the
    write happens only if the cache still holds the ``(body digest, source digest)`` the
    caller observed. ``("", "")`` expects no cache at all, and ``None`` (the default)
    publishes unconditionally. The pair rather than the body alone, because identical bytes
    can be published for a DIFFERENT source and overwriting that provenance with this
    call's own is exactly what the repoint rule then refuses at the next boot. It exists because a fetch is slow and a refresh is not the only
    writer: a refresher that fetched v2 over a slow link, while ``policy fetch --force``
    published v3, would otherwise write v2 over v3 and then INSTALL v2 — the ceiling
    rolling backward to a looser document, which is the one direction this tier must
    never move on its own.

    Returns whether the document was published. ``False`` means either the swap found the
    cache moved on (the caller must not install what it fetched) or the write failed.

    A **compare-and-swap**, like the publish it undoes: the rollback happens only while
    the cache still holds *published_pair*, the ``(body digest, source digest)`` this
    refresh put there. The pair for the same reason the publish uses one — identical bytes
    under a different source are not this refresh's work to undo. The
    publish and this failure are separated by ``apply_ceiling``, so another process can
    publish in between — and rolling back over it would destroy a valid, newer ceiling
    nobody asked us to touch. When the digests disagree, the newer copy is left alone;
    this refresh's document is no longer the one on disk, so there is nothing of ours to
    undo.

    Called only from ``refresh_now``'s failure arm, where the new bytes are already on
    disk because the publish is deliberately confirmed before the install. Restoring
    keeps this module's promise that a document failing a mandated check never becomes
    what the next boot adopts.

    ``previous`` is ``None`` when there was nothing cached for this source, and then
    there is nothing to restore TO: the rejected bytes stay, and that is the honest
    state — deleting them would turn a refused push into "no central ceiling at all",
    which a cache-only child answers by refusing to start. A stale-but-composable
    document is the better of the two, and the running ceiling is untouched either way.

    Best-effort and never raises, for the same reason ``write_cache`` is: the caller is
    already returning a failure, and a restore that cannot be written must not turn a
    reported rejection into an exception on a background timer.

    The age is deliberately NOT restarted -- ``fetched_at`` is carried from the copy
    being put back, so a fleet's ``max_cache_age_secs`` still measures from the last
