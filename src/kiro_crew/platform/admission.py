"""Plugin admission control — the gate that decides whether a plugin may load.

This is the policy layer on top of the structural discovery gates
(fail-closed discovery, contract-version, ADD-only floor). It lets a managed
fleet **reject or ban** a plugin before its code is ever imported, using a
defense-in-depth model:

1. **Kill-switch (`banned`)** — a fleet can ban a plugin by name; the ban always
   wins, even in an otherwise-open policy. This is the remote-disable control.
2. **Marketplace allowlist (`approved`)** — when the policy carries a non-empty
   allowlist, only listed plugins are admitted. This is the marketplace review
   gate: a plugin is admitted only after it has been reviewed and added.
3. **Verify-before-run signature (`require_signature`)** — the plugin ships a
   signed manifest; admission verifies the signature against a trust key the
   *policy* (not the plugin) carries, before `ep.load()`. This is the
   supply-chain control.
4. **Capability ceiling** — the manifest declares the capabilities the plugin
   requests (tools, network egress, credential paths). Admission rejects a
   plugin whose declared capabilities exceed the policy ceiling.

Trust-root invariant: the admission policy is loaded from a **fleet-controlled
source** (`KIROCREW_ADMISSION_POLICY` env path, or
`~/.kiro/crew/admission_policy.json`), never from the plugin being admitted, so a
plugin cannot approve or un-ban itself. The public edition ships **no** policy →
default-open (admit), preserving today's behavior; a managed fleet ships a policy
and the gate enforces.

The plugin manifest is read **without importing the plugin module** (from the
installed distribution's files), so a malicious plugin's code never runs before
the admission decision.

See ``docs/system-specs/modules/platform-context.md`` (Plugin admission).

    Distinct from :func:`load_admission_policy` on purpose.  That function is the

    emits a **critical** ``governance_degraded`` SEL when the policy is
    absent/unreadable — correct exactly once per process at boot, and wrong for any
    other reader.  The governance loader needs only ``require_policy_signature`` +
    ``trust_keys``, and it runs on paths that repeat (``gatewayd`` re-loads the
    security policy per app call), so reusing the audited loader would flip the
    governance indicator to degraded and append a critical audit record on every
    such call.

    On an absent, unreadable, or malformed policy this returns the plain permissive

    refuses to admit plugins off the same file), and it must not additionally make

    file is outside the policy-signature threat model — they would set the flag to
    ``false``, which parses fine — so fail-closing on a *malformed* file would only
    catch a clumsy version of an attack the design concedes, at the cost of turning
    a non-atomic fleet push or a hand-edit typo into an unbootable host.  Corruption
