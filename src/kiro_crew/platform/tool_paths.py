"""Shared, bounded, depth-aware extraction of a tool call's target file paths.

This module is the SINGLE source of the traversal that both the sensitive-path
keystone in :mod:`kiro_crew.hooks` (hard-deny plane) and the governance
intersection plane in :mod:`kiro_crew.platform.governance` (permit-by-default
plane) rely on. It lives BELOW both on purpose: ``hooks`` imports FROM
``platform.governance``, so ``governance`` cannot import ``hooks`` without a
cycle, and both need the same walk. Keeping it here — and depending on nothing
but the stdlib and :mod:`collections.abc` — lets either caller import it with no
cycle and no heavy transitive dependency.

The two callers apply DIFFERENT fail semantics to the ``truncated`` flag (the
keystone hard-denies an unverifiable scan; governance denies only the scopes the
tool kind implies, per its permit-by-default contract), but the extraction
itself is identical and must not drift between them.

#: symlink-following syscall chains) — so an attacker-shaped batch carrying tens
#: of thousands of paths could stall the loop. The cap does NOT fail open: hitting
#: it sets ``TargetPaths.truncated`` and the gate DENIES an unverifiable call
#: (same deny-by-default shape as the unrecoverable-shell-command branch).

    Returns ALL of them rather than the first match, and callers deny if ANY is
    forbidden. That is deliberately different from "normalize the aliases onto one
    key and reject conflicts": a conflict rule has to decide which spelling wins,
    and picking wrong is how a sensitive path slips past. Checking every value
    present cannot be gamed by adding a second, innocent-looking alias, and needs
    no adjudication.

    Nesting is walked for the same ground-truth reason: a batch-shaped tool
    carries its real targets inside an array argument (e.g.
    ``{"operations": [{"mode": "Line", "path": …}]}``), so an extraction that
    read only the top-level keys never surfaced those paths to the
    sensitive-path keystone — the call was then evaluated as having no target
    at all and could auto-approve a read the flat spelling of the same path
    would have denied. The walk is ITERATIVE and EXHAUSTIVE — there is no depth
    bound that a sufficiently nested path could hide beyond, and no
    ``RecursionError`` can escape into the gate — visits every dict/list value,
    collects strings under ``TARGET_PATH_KEYS`` wherever they appear (including
    a list of strings directly under such a key), and stays extract-only: no
    sensitivity decision is made here, order of first appearance is preserved,
    and duplicates collapse (set-backed, so collection is linear). The only
    limits are the ``_TARGET_PATH_MAX_PATHS`` / ``_TARGET_PATH_MAX_NODES``
    work caps, and those fail CLOSED: the result is marked ``truncated`` and
    the gate denies the call as unverifiable rather than trusting a partial
    scan. Over-extraction is the safe direction, since callers deny on ANY hit
    and the consent prompt merely discloses more.
