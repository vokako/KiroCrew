"""Windows security-descriptor reads for the provider-CLI trust policy.

``github_runner``'s trust question is "could anything other than the gateway
user or the system have replaced this binary". On POSIX that is answered from
``st_uid`` plus the group/other write bits. On Windows those fields carry no
information -- ``os.stat`` reports ``st_uid == 0`` and ``st_mode == 0o777`` for
every path -- so the ownership half of the POSIX predicate always passes and
the permission half always refuses, independent of the file examined. This
module supplies the real answer from the object's security descriptor instead.

It deliberately holds NO policy: it reads an owner SID and the set of
principals that hold a right capable of REPLACING the object, and hands both to
``github_runner`` to judge. Keeping the read separate from the decision is what
makes the policy testable against synthetic ACLs.

Only ``ctypes`` is used. ``pywin32`` would be a new platform-conditional
dependency for five calls that the standard library can already make.

Substitution rights, and why the POSIX predicate cannot be ported bit-for-bit
=============================================================================

Two access-mask bits mean different things depending on the object type::

    bit 0x2   FILE = FILE_WRITE_DATA      DIRECTORY = FILE_ADD_FILE
    bit 0x4   FILE = FILE_APPEND_DATA     DIRECTORY = FILE_ADD_SUBDIRECTORY

POSIX collapses every directory mutation into one ``w`` bit, so "the parent
directory is writable" really does imply "the entry can be swapped" -- unlink
and rename come with it. Windows decomposes them, and neither ``FILE_ADD_FILE``
nor ``FILE_ADD_SUBDIRECTORY`` lets the holder touch an *existing* entry.
Replacing one needs ``FILE_DELETE_CHILD`` on the parent, or ``DELETE`` /
``WRITE_DAC`` / ``WRITE_OWNER`` on the entry itself.

The distinction is load-bearing rather than pedantic: the default ACL on ``C:\\``
grants ``NT AUTHORITY\\Authenticated Users`` the ``ADD_SUBDIRECTORY`` right, so a
predicate that reads that bit as a write grant refuses every stock Windows
install once the walk reaches the drive root.

    """Replace *path*'s DACL with an owner-only one, protected from inheritance.

    The in-process replacement for shelling out to ``icacls``. Same resulting
    descriptor -- inheritance stripped, one full-control ACE per entry in *sids*
    -- reached with three ``advapi32`` calls instead of a process spawn, which is
    what lets a caller on the asyncio event loop apply it without parking the
    loop for the duration of a subprocess.

    *sids* are SID strings (``S-1-...``), in the order they should appear in the
    ACL, and the POLICY of which principals to grant stays with the caller: this
    function is deliberately mechanical so the decision about who may read a
    secret lives in one place rather than being split across a ctypes helper.
    An empty *sids* is refused -- an ACL with no ACEs is not "owner-only", it
    denies everyone including the owner, and writing one would brick the file.

    *require_local_volume* deliberately does NOT live here: a caller that cannot
    afford an unbounded SMB round-trip has to know that BEFORE it starts the
    write, so the decision belongs at the call site via :func:`volume_is_local`,
    ahead of any other filesystem work. Asking here would be too late -- the
    caller would already have paid for whatever it did to reach this call.

    Raises :class:`AclWriteFailed` on any failure, having written nothing: the
    descriptor is only handed to the kernel once fully built, so a failure part
    way through construction cannot leave a half-applied DACL.
