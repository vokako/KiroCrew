"""Transcript extraction and payload shaping for intent-level session summaries.

Two jobs, both deliberately free of any model call so they can be tested
directly:

* :func:`extract_turns` turns raw transcript records into the bounded input a
  summarization pass reads.
* :func:`normalize_payload` validates and clamps whatever the model returns
  before it reaches the sidecar cache, so a malformed generation degrades to a
  smaller valid summary instead of poisoning the panel.

Why the input is shaped the way it is: a session transcript is dominated by
assistant records and their tool payloads, while intent lives almost entirely in
the (small) user messages. Reading ``role``/``content`` only, keeping user text
whole and excerpting assistant text, holds the input to around 1% of a
transcript's bytes and drops tool output entirely, which carries nothing about
intent.
