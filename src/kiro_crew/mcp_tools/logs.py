"""The kiro-cli log reader tool: what it advertises and what it does.

``schemas()`` returns the ADVERTISEMENT half; ``HANDLERS`` maps the name to the
function that runs it. Both halves live here so the contract and behavior are
read together, and ``test_mcp_tool_registry`` fails if one arrives without the
other (see ``skills.py`` — this module follows the same template).

WHY THIS TOOL EXISTS: kiro-cli's identity store is fenced (it also holds SSO
tokens), and the command gate is a deliberately coarse, verb-independent path
matcher — so the agent driving kiro-cli has no sanctioned way to read kiro-cli's
own logs when the backend rejects a turn. This is that
sanctioned channel: ONE reviewed code path that reads only kiro-cli's mcp/lsp
PROTOCOL logs and runs every byte through the shared redaction stack
(``redact_credentials`` / ``redact_exfiltration_urls`` plus the diagnostics
collector's ``_EXTRA_REDACTIONS`` for the bearer/Authorization/mc_token shapes
those two miss) before returning it. It does NOT widen the gate and does NOT
take a path carve-out on the fence: redaction is what makes returning the bytes
safe.

SCOPE IS THE OTHER HALF OF THAT SAFETY. ``kiro-chat.log`` and the session
transcripts are deliberately NOT read. Each is a single shared host file per
gateway, so it interleaves every concurrent session's conversation, and the
redaction stack is a CREDENTIAL pass that does not narrow prose — an
agent-callable read would hand session A's private conversation to session B.
The mcp/lsp protocol logs are what actually explain a rejected turn, so the
tool stays there. See ``diagnostics.read_kiro_cli_logs``.

Handlers reach shared plumbing as attributes of ``mcp_core`` (``mcp_core.sel``,
``mcp_core._resolve_session_key``) so a test that rebinds one still intercepts —
an attribute lookup resolves at CALL time.
