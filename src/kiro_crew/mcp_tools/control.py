"""The session control: waiting, monitoring loops, questions, and follow-ups tools: what they advertise and what they do.

``schemas()`` returns the ADVERTISEMENT half of each tool -- its name, the
model-facing description, and the JSON Schema a call is validated against.
``HANDLERS`` maps each of those names to the function that runs it. Both halves
of a tool live here so its contract and its behavior are read together, and
``test_mcp_tool_registry`` fails if one arrives without the other.

Handlers reach this server's shared plumbing as attributes of ``mcp_core`` --
``mcp_core._post``, the identity resolvers, the governance vets. That is
deliberate rather than untidy: an attribute lookup resolves at CALL time, so a
test that rebinds one on the module still intercepts the handler. Importing
those names directly here would bind them at import time and silently escape
every existing patch site.

    """Encode a validated directive AND publish it out of band; return the text.

    Two delivery paths, one each way round:

    * The MARKER in the returned text is the original path. A consumer that can
      verify the call's ``_meta.kiro`` identity (kiro-cli) decodes and applies it
      from there, exactly as before — this function changes nothing for that
      backend.
    * The out-of-band POST is the provider-neutral path. ``_post`` already carries
      ``X-Session-Key`` (and the gateway kernel-verifies that claim on the unix
      socket), so the gateway parks the payload for the RIGHT session without the
      model's tool result being trusted for anything. What travels is the CALL
      (tool name + raw arguments), never the payload: the gateway re-runs this
      tool on those arguments to derive the payload and computes the claim key
      itself, and the consumer recomputes that key from the ``tool_call``
      frame — so neither the result body's shape nor a caller-authored payload
      decides what lands. A backend that emits no ``_meta.kiro`` identity has
      no other way to reach its own control plane.

    Order matters: encode FIRST. ``encode`` refuses an oversized payload by
    returning a marker-less error string, and a refused directive must NOT be
    published — otherwise the model is told "nothing was applied" while a record
    sits waiting to apply it.

    Fail-soft on the POST, and SILENT by design. An older gateway with no such
    route, or one that is simply down, must not turn a working tool call into an
    error: the marker is already in hand and the kiro-cli path still works. There
    is no log line because this module runs as a stdio MCP server, where the
    process's own streams are the protocol channel — and because the failure that
    matters is reported at the CONSUMER, which is the side that knows whether a
    directive actually landed.
