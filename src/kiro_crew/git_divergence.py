"""Ahead/behind divergence counting against an upstream ref.

Several gateway surfaces ask "how far is this checkout from its upstream"
before acting on the answer, and two of them gate actions that are hard to
undo: the CLI's hard-reset recovery path, and the update-check verdict that
the unattended auto-apply path reads. Re-deriving the same fragile details per
surface — the three-dot range, ``--left-right``'s left-is-ahead semantics, the
two-token split, the ``int()`` conversion, the subprocess timeout, and what an
unreadable result means — makes the copies agree by luck rather than by
structure. This module is the one owner of the
COUNTING. Every caller keeps its own POLICY about what the counts mean,
because the surfaces intentionally disagree: the update check offers only a
fast-forward, the apply precondition refuses only true divergence, the CLI
refuses to reset even an ahead-only checkout, and the papyrus status panel
merely displays the distance.

The one property no caller may lose: **failure is never (0, 0)**. A count
that cannot be read returns :class:`DivergenceUnreadable`, a distinct type,
because ``(0, 0)`` also means "in sync" and a sentinel pair would silently
convert a fail-closed gate into a fail-open one. Callers decide explicitly
what an unreadable count means for them; the gates guarding destructive
actions refuse.

Three call shapes are deliberate, not redundancy:

* :func:`count_divergence` — async, for handlers running on the event loop.
* :func:`count_divergence_sync` — blocking, for the one-shot ``kirocrew
  update`` CLI path that runs with no event loop.
* :func:`divergence_count_args` + :func:`parse_divergence_counts` — the raw
  argv and the parser, for a caller that must spawn through its own hardened
  runner (papyrus routes every git call through its sandbox chokepoint with
  config-override pins, and counting through this module's spawns would
  bypass that). The primitives keep the fragile details here even when the
  spawn cannot be.
