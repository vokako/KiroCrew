"""Cron service for scheduling agent tasks.

Jobs are stored in the config directory (``~/.kiro/crew/crons.json`` by default,
overridden by ``KIROCREW_HOME``) and executed by a background
asyncio timer.  Each job fires a callback (typically delivering the result to
the dashboard and, when configured, the owner's Slack DM).

Cross-process safety: the CLI and gateway run as separate processes sharing
the same ``crons.json``.  All read-modify-write cycles use advisory file
locking (fcntl), and a content-digest ``_sync()`` detects external file changes
before every mutation.  Job execution releases the lock so long-running jobs
don't block the CLI.

Jobs are created via MCP tools (``cron_add``) or the CLI (``kirocrew cron add``).

Supports three schedule types:
- ``every`` — recurring interval (min 60s)
- ``at`` — one-shot at a unix timestamp
- ``cron`` — standard cron expression (min hour dom month dow)

    build nothing from it. It exists for the DIAGNOSTIC caller, which must tell
    "you have no crons" (fine) from "your crons stopped loading" (a fault);
    runtime readers take ``[0]`` and keep degrading quietly, so the records
    half is unchanged by it.

    Single owner of the read-parse-shape prologue for the three readers that
    deliberately bypass the scheduler so they work with no running gateway
    (:func:`referenced_skill_names`, :func:`unhealthy_jobs_from_disk`,
    :meth:`CronService.count_enabled_from_disk`). Each had grown its own
    spelling of this prologue and they had drifted in WHICH corruption they
    survived, so a store that one reader shrugged off crashed another. This is
    NOT every reader of the file — see the exclusions below.

    Every failure mode collapses to "no records", because all three callers
    degrade quietly by contract rather than propagate:

    * ``OSError`` — no file at all (every fresh install), permissions, or a
      directory where the file should be.
    * ``UnicodeError`` — the store is bytes on disk and can hold invalid
      UTF-8. Reading with an explicit encoding also pins the decode to the
      one :func:`~kiro_crew.atomic_write.atomic_write` writes, rather than to
      the caller's locale.
    * ``ValueError`` / ``TypeError`` — unparseable JSON.
    * ``RecursionError`` — deeply nested JSON. It subclasses ``RuntimeError``,
      NOT ``ValueError``, so it escapes a decode-error tuple and would abort
      the caller from inside the read it expected to be safe.
    * Shape — a document that parses but is not an object holding a ``jobs``
      list (a top-level ``[]``, a scalar, ``{"jobs": null}``).

    Non-dict entries are dropped here so that no caller repeats the check.
    All three already discarded them — two by an explicit ``isinstance``
    guard, one by letting :func:`_job_from_record` reject them — so
    filtering centrally preserves each caller's behaviour exactly.

    Three readers are deliberately NOT served, because each owes the user or
    the scheduler a louder reaction than a quiet degrade:

    * :meth:`CronService._load` reads bytes handed over by ``_sync``, logs a
      warning naming the corruption, and resets the store fingerprint — those
      are scheduler-state side effects folding in here would silence.
    * :func:`~kiro_crew.portability._sanitize_imported_crons` rewrites an
      unreadable import to an empty store and reports it to the caller.
    * :func:`~kiro_crew.snapshot._merge_crons` prints which path it could not
      read, skips the merge, and answers ``False`` so its caller can report
      the refusal instead of a success.

    The latter two still guard on ``(OSError, ValueError)`` only, so a deeply
    nested store aborts an import or a snapshot merge there. That is a real
    remaining gap, left for separate work: both owe the user a message naming
    the file, which this quiet loader cannot give them.

    rides the SAME read rather than a second one: a store the scheduler cannot
    load yields two empty buckets, which is indistinguishable from a healthy
    empty store in the pairs alone, so the caller needs the flag to avoid
    handing back a clean bill of health for a stopped scheduler.

    Read-only + best-effort, and a sibling of :func:`referenced_skill_names` for
    the same reason: it reads ``crons.json`` directly so it needs no running
    scheduler. ``kirocrew doctor`` is the caller, and a diagnostic whose purpose

    Non-raising by contract, via :func:`_read_job_records`, which owns the

    invalid UTF-8, malformed JSON (including deeply nested input), a store not

    that most needs the caller's other diagnostics, and must not get a
    traceback instead of them.

    The two buckets are disjoint and carry different remediation. A job only
    reaches ``auto_paused`` by failing repeatedly, so it almost always carries
    ``last_status="error"`` too; reporting it in both would give a caller
    contradictory advice (resume it vs. re-trigger it) for one job. Auto-pause
    wins because re-triggering a paused job does not un-pause it.

    A user-paused job appears in NEITHER bucket. ``user_paused`` is deliberately
    distinct from ``auto_paused``: a job the user paused on purpose is not a
    health signal, and a stale ``last_status`` from before they paused it is not
    either. Both flags can be set at once — :meth:`CronStore._enable_job_locked`
    clears ``auto_paused`` only when ENABLING, so pausing an already-auto-paused

        Returns the ids actually removed (sorted, empty when nothing drained)
        so the caller can SEL-audit them after releasing the store lock.

        Called from :meth:`_tick_scan_locked` (the timer tick's worker-thread
        transaction) inside its ``_file_lock`` block, so the delete+save is
        serialized against every other
        mutator exactly like the other locked cores. Removes only the queued
        ids still present after the tick's ``_sync``; saves once iff something
        was actually removed (an all-missing queue never rewrites the file).
        An id no longer present was already removed elsewhere, so dropping it
        is correct -- but ONLY when the load succeeded. Under ``_load_failed``
        the list is unknown rather than empty, so this returns before claiming
        (see the guard below) instead of intersecting against nothing.

        Cross-thread safety: this drain runs in the timer tick's WORKER thread
        while :meth:`defer_removal` adds ids from the EVENT-LOOP thread. The
        queue is claimed with a single-bytecode tuple swap
        (``pending, self._pending_removals = self._pending_removals, set()``),
        which is atomic under the GIL. A concurrent ``defer_removal`` add
        therefore lands EITHER in ``pending`` (drained now) OR in the fresh
        replacement set (drained next tick) — it can never fall into the gap
        between a read and a reset and be silently erased. ``present`` is
        computed AFTER the swap so the intersection sees the post-swap job
        list, and the in-memory disable performed by ``defer_removal`` keeps
        even an id deferred to the next tick from re-firing meanwhile.

        ``_arm_timer`` needs the event loop). Same shape, and the same critical
        property, as :meth:`_remove_jobs_by_owner_locked`: BOTH decisions this
        makes — which owner keys name a retired principal, and which jobs still
        carry one of them — happen AFTER the in-lock ``_sync_for_write()``
        reload, against the authoritative on-disk state rather than a snapshot
        taken before the lock.

        That is the whole reason this exists instead of a caller-side
        ``list_jobs()`` loop over :meth:`adopt_job`. ``list_jobs`` is cache-only
        with up to one timer-poll interval of cross-process staleness, and both
        decisions are wrong when read from it:

        * OWNER staleness — between a pre-lock snapshot and a per-id write,
          another surface (the CLI's ``cron adopt``, a cron-injected slot
          re-stamping its key) can hand the job to a DIFFERENT owner, and an
          unconditional per-id release would clear that new owner, silently
          unbinding a job from a session that legitimately owns it.
        * PRINCIPAL staleness — a ``cron:<job id>`` owner is only live while that
          job exists, so its jobs must be kept owned; but a CLI ``cron remove``
          inside the staleness window leaves the cache still listing the job, and
          a cached liveness check would call the dead principal live and skip
          releasing its children. Nothing re-runs the delete funnel, so those
          jobs strand permanently.

        Conditioning both on the reloaded state makes the release a
        compare-and-clear against current truth: a re-adopted job keeps its new
        owner, a job whose cron principal is still scheduled keeps its owner, and
        either is simply absent from the returned ids.

        Ownership is matched through :func:`cron_owner_matches`, not ``==``,
        because one cron principal is stamped under several spellings
        (``cron:<job id>``, ``cron:<job id>:<run id>``,
        ``cron:<job id>:<agent>``) depending on which run created the job. An
        exact comparison misses a child stamped with a longer spelling than the
        caller holds, and a match MISS is not a release failure, so nothing warns.

        All-or-nothing within the single ``_file_lock`` transaction: a contended
        store raises :class:`CronStoreBusy` before any mutation, and a save that
        fails after the mutation puts every touched owner back before re-raising,
        so the cache never reports a release that is not on disk. Returns the ids
        actually released.

        Selects through :meth:`_sync_for_write`, not ``_sync()``, for the reason
        spelled out on :meth:`_remove_jobs_by_owner_locked`: ``_load`` degrades an
        unreadable store to an empty job list, so an ownership scan over it would
        answer "this session owned nothing", skip the save, and report a clean
        release while the still-stamped jobs sit on disk. ``_sync_for_write``
        refuses first, so the caller learns the release did not happen. It also
        fails the liveness read closed, which matters in the opposite direction:
        an empty job list would call every cron principal dead and release jobs a
        live cron still owns.

        * ``list_jobs_async`` locks and syncs, but degrades on BOTH store
          failures: :meth:`_synced_snapshot` swallows :class:`CronStoreBusy` and
          returns the cache, and it syncs through ``_sync()``, whose ``_load``
          turns an unreadable store into an empty job list. A contended or
          corrupt store therefore reads as "no owners" — indistinguishable from
          an honestly ownerless store, and the wrong answer for a caller about to

        So this raises instead of degrading: :class:`CronStoreBusy` out of
        :meth:`_file_lock` on sustained contention, :class:`CronStoreUnreadable`
        out of :meth:`_sync_for_write` on a store ``_load`` could not parse. The

        Read-only: no mutation, no ``_save``, so nothing to roll back. Returns
        owner keys, not jobs, because the scan's only question is which owner
        spellings exist — the release re-resolves ownership and liveness per job

        caller-side decision on state that is stale the moment the lock drops.

        Unlike :meth:`list_jobs` (which calls ``_sync()`` → ``_load()`` →
        ``_arm_timer()``), this performs ONLY a read-only file parse. It never
        mutates loop-owned state (``self._jobs``, ``self._last_mtime``) and
        never touches the asyncio timer, so it is safe to invoke from a worker
        thread via ``asyncio.to_thread``.

        This exists specifically for the dashboard WS status pusher, which needs
        an enabled-job count off the event loop: routing ``list_jobs`` through a
        worker thread would run ``_arm_timer()`` (which calls
        ``asyncio.create_task``) with no running loop in that thread, raising
        ``RuntimeError`` — and because ``_arm_timer`` cancels the existing timer
        first, that would silently stop all scheduled jobs until restart.

        Enabled semantics come from the shared ``_record_is_enabled`` predicate
        (the single owner used by ``_load`` too): a job is enabled when it is
        neither user-paused nor auto-paused (with the legacy ``!enabled``
        fallback for stores written before those fields existed). A slightly stale count is
        acceptable here — the caller caches it and the atomic tmp→rename write
        in ``_save`` guarantees a concurrent read sees a whole file, never a
        partial one.

        The read, parse and shape guards are :func:`_read_job_records`, shared
        with the other two direct readers. Routing through it is what keeps the
        WS status pusher alive on a corrupt store: catching only
        ``(OSError, json.JSONDecodeError)`` here would let invalid UTF-8
        (``UnicodeDecodeError``, from a bare locale-dependent ``read_text()``)
        and deeply nested JSON (``RecursionError``, a ``RuntimeError``) escape
        and kill the pusher. A count of 0 is the correct degrade: an
        unreadable store has no jobs anyone can schedule.

        The reduction itself lives in :func:`enabled_count_from_disk`, whose
        ``loadable`` half this method deliberately discards — the status pusher
        wants a number it can always render, not a fault to handle.

        re-run the crash the breaker exists to stop. That boot is the only one
        that retries, so it keeps both the claim and the evidence intact.

        the timer arms, so a fault in it must cost at most the net: letting one
        propagate would fail ``start()`` and leave the operator with no scheduler
        at all, which is strictly worse than the crash loop it is trying to stop.

        parks the calling thread in an uninterruptible kernel wait for as long
        as another holder keeps the lock — and every store *mutator*
        (:meth:`add_job`, :meth:`update_job`, :meth:`remove_job`,
        :meth:`enable_job`, …) takes this lock directly on the gateway's
        asyncio event loop. A single slow holder (a large atomic save on
        network storage, the CLI process, or the off-loop batch-remove worker)
        would therefore freeze the ENTIRE event loop — every unrelated session,
        timer, and reaper — until it released.

        The non-blocking spin polls with a short ``time.sleep`` between
        attempts (releasing the GIL so worker threads make progress) and raises
        :class:`CronStoreBusy` (a :class:`TimeoutError` subclass) after
        ``timeout`` rather than blocking indefinitely. flock on separate open
        descriptions mutually excludes within a single process too, so this
        still serializes the loop-side mutators against the ``asyncio.to_thread``
        batch-remove and mutator workers.

        The loop-resident mutator boundaries do NOT call this directly on the
        event loop — they use the ``*_async`` mutator variants (``add_job_async``
        et al.), which offload this lock+save to a worker thread and translate a
        raised :class:`CronStoreBusy` into a clean retryable error. The bounded
        sync path here still serves the CLI/MCP server processes (no event loop
        to park) and remains a strict improvement over the old unbounded flock.

        The ``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`` invariant is MACHINE-ENFORCED:
        :meth:`_guard_off_event_loop` raises :class:`CronLoopSafetyError` (strict
        mode) or warns (default) if this is entered on a thread with a running
        asyncio loop — so a future writer that calls a sync mutator on the loop
        is caught rather than silently re-freezing it.

        EXHAUSTIVE AUDIT — every ``_sync()`` caller and raw store-``read``
        site in this module, classified by whether it can run on the gateway
        event loop. INVARIANT: **no ``_sync()`` / whole-file ``read_bytes()`` +
        hash ever runs on the loop.** All blocking store I/O is either in a
        worker thread (``asyncio.to_thread``) or in a loop-less process
        (CLI / MCP). Enforced mechanically by
        ``test_cron_locking_regression.py::TestReadPathsLocked`` (on-loop reads
        AND the timer tick must not touch the store on the loop).

        ``_sync()`` callers
          • _persist_add_locked / _update_job_locked_kw / _remove_job_locked /
            _remove_jobs_locked / _enable_job_locked / _ack_job_locked /
            _unack_job_locked  → OFF-LOOP: reached from the loop only via their
            ``*_async`` wrappers, which ``await asyncio.to_thread(...)``; also
            called directly by loop-less CLI/MCP/app-SDK processes.
          • _synced_snapshot  → OFF-LOOP (worker): the body of
            list_jobs_async / get_job_async / run_job's offloaded refresh.
          • _tick_scan_locked  → OFF-LOOP (worker): the timer tick's
            (``_on_timer``) offloaded lock+sync+drain+snapshot transaction.
          • _merge_job_result  → OFF-LOOP on the gateway (``_run_job_isolated``
            calls it via ``asyncio.to_thread``); loop-less CLI/MCP may call it
            directly.
          • run_job  → now OFF-LOOP: its former on-loop ``_sync()`` moved into
            the ``_synced_snapshot`` offload; the ``_executing`` claim stays on
            the loop and does NO store I/O.

        Raw store ``read_bytes()`` sites
          • _record_fingerprint (post-load/save) / _sync / _load  → all reached
            only through the OFF-LOOP ``_sync()`` callers above (or a loop-less
            process). None on the loop.
          • initial ``_load()`` (construction / ``start()``)  → the plain
            constructor loads INLINE (loop-less CLI/MCP/apps-SDK/tests only —
            no loop to park). Loop contexts (the gateway) build via the async
            factory ``CronService.create()``, which sets
            ``_defer_initial_load=True`` and runs ``_load()`` via
            ``asyncio.to_thread``; ``start()`` likewise offloads its ``_load()``.
            ``_running`` is False during both, so neither arms a timer off-loop.
            OFF-LOOP on the gateway.

        Cache-only (NO store I/O at all — never lock, read, or hash)
          • list_jobs / get_job  → on-loop hot paths; return the atomically-
            swapped in-memory snapshot.
          • _reaper_loop's ``jobs_by_id`` snapshot  → on-loop; cache-only,
            same atomic-reference-swap rationale as list_jobs.

        Every user-facing mutator edits ``self._jobs`` and only then reaches
        ``_save()``, so refusing at the disk boundary alone left the caller told
        "rejected" while the mutation stayed in the in-memory list — a resumed job
        the timer can still fire, an ack already consumed, a removal already gone
        from the cache. All TEN user-facing writers in ``_save``'s audit table now
        route through here; the three BACKGROUND ones deliberately do not (below).
        That is reachable, not theoretical:
        :meth:`_tick_scan_locked` documents an in-memory-snapshot fallback for a
        contended lock — it skips ``_sync()`` and returns ``list(self._jobs)`` — so
        the due-scan could hand a refused job to the runner.

        Refusing up front rather than undoing afterwards is what makes that
        unrepresentable. ``_save()`` cannot roll back a mutation it never saw: its
        write-path audit lists roughly a dozen writers, each touching different
        fields, so a generic rollback there has nothing to key on and a partial one
        would be a fresh defect. The check sits after ``_sync()`` because
        ``_sync()`` is what sets ``_load_failed``.

        ``_save()`` keeps its own guard rather than delegating to this one: it is
        the backstop for any writer that does not come through here, and the three
        BACKGROUND writers depend on it firing at the disk boundary — each wraps
        only its ``_save()`` call, so an earlier raise would abort the reaper and
        the tick instead of degrading them.

        RAISES :exc:`CronStoreUnreadable` when the last :meth:`_load` could not
        read the store, instead of writing. ``_load`` degrades an unreadable
        store to an empty job list, which is indistinguishable HERE from an
        honestly empty one — and this method serialises ``self._jobs``
        wholesale, so one mutation after a failed load would persist that empty
        list over a store still holding records. Measured on the base handler
        alone (a ``json.JSONDecodeError`` store plus one ``add_job``), so this
        is not a hazard the widened ``_load`` guard introduced.

        It RAISES rather than returning quietly because a silent refusal is the
        same silence-shaped failure this change exists to break: the mutator
        would return success to the dashboard/CLI/MCP caller for a write that
        never happened. Every writer below reaches disk through this one
        method, so the single check covers all of them; the three BACKGROUND
        writers catch the error and degrade so a corrupt store cannot take down
        the reaper, the tick scan or the job runner. A missing store and an
        honestly empty one are NOT failures (``_load`` clears the flag for
        both), so a fresh install still writes.

        WRITE-PATH AUDIT — every ``_save()`` call site and every structural
        ``self._jobs`` mutation, each classified locked/unlocked and
        on-loop/off-loop. INVARIANT: every writer holds :meth:`_file_lock` and
        is reached from the gateway event loop ONLY via ``asyncio.to_thread``
        (or runs in a genuinely loop-less CLI/MCP process). No bare on-loop
        ``_save()`` remains. Keep this table in sync when adding a writer.
