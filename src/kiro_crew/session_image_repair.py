"""Repair kiro-cli session transcripts that an oversized image has wedged.

A provider rejects the ENTIRE request when a many-image conversation carries any
image wider or taller than :data:`kiro_crew.imaging.MAX_IMAGE_EDGE_PX`::

    messages.60.content.0.image.source.base64.data: At least one of the image
    dimensions exceed max allowed size for many-image requests: 2000 pixels

kiro-cli replays the whole message history every turn, so the offending block
sits at a fixed history index that nothing evicts. The session does not fail at
the turn that stored the image; it fails on every turn from the moment enough
images accumulate for the request to count as many-image. Capping new captures
therefore cannot heal a transcript that already carries one -- the stored bytes
have to be rewritten, or the conversation is over.

Why this is a user-invoked command and not a sweeper
----------------------------------------------------
The files belong to kiro-cli, not to Kiro Crew, and automatically rewriting
another tool's data directory was ruled out. Healing existing damage is an
explicit action with a visible dry run and a backup sidecar, so the operator
decides when a transcript is safe to touch. Run it only while the session is
idle: kiro-cli appends to these files, and an append that lands during the
rewrite is lost.

What a repair does to a block it cannot fix
-------------------------------------------
:func:`kiro_crew.imaging.downscale_image_block` fails closed -- it returns
``None`` when no rendition fits the budget. Leaving such a block in place keeps
the session dead, so it is replaced by a text block naming the drop. Losing one
image is strictly better than losing every later turn.

    ``O_CREAT | O_EXCL`` rather than a check followed by a write, because the
    check-then-write form has a window: two concurrent ``--apply`` runs can both
    find no sidecar, and the later one's read then captures ALREADY-REPAIRED
    content and replaces the genuine pre-repair copy. Exclusive create is the
    filesystem primitive for this -- exactly one caller wins, the other gets
    ``EEXIST`` -- so the guarantee is atomic rather than merely narrow.

    Three properties fall out of the same call rather than needing separate
    defences. It refuses an existing regular file, which is the re-run case. It
    refuses a symlink, dangling or not, because ``O_CREAT | O_EXCL`` will not
    follow one -- so the predictable name cannot be used to redirect the write
    into a file the planter could not write directly. And it never truncates,
    so the previous sidecar's bytes are not at risk even momentarily.

    This gives up ``atomic_write``'s temp-file-and-rename crash safety, which is
    why the partial file is removed on any failure: at this point in the repair
    NOTHING has been modified yet, so a discarded partial backup costs a re-run
    and nothing else. The failure that mattered -- a backup destroyed after a
    repair already dropped an image -- is the one exclusive create prevents.

    Written to a sibling temp file and renamed so a crash mid-write cannot
    leave a truncated transcript, which would cost the whole session rather
    than one image.

    *expect* is the ``(size, mtime_ns)`` the scan saw. When given it is checked
    TWICE: once up front, and again immediately before :func:`os.replace`. The
    rewrite is built from lines read earlier, so an append landing in between
    would be dropped silently.

    Two checks rather than one because the work between them is not quick. The
    backup is a full copy of the whole transcript and the temp file is a
    full rewrite plus an ``fsync`` -- on a 26MB transcript that is seconds, and
    an append arriving inside it would pass the early check and still be lost.
    The early check is kept because failing before copying tens of megabytes is
    cheaper than failing after.

    The residual window cannot be closed, only narrowed: between the final stat
    and the rename there is no lock to hold, and kiro-cli does not participate
    in one. What changes is the width -- two syscalls instead of the duration of
    a multi-megabyte write. Passing ``None`` skips both checks, which is only
    right when the caller already knows the file is quiescent.

    What DOES address the realistic trigger is the liveness refusal: unless
    *allow_live*, a transcript whose sibling lock names a running kiro-cli is
    refused outright with :class:`TranscriptLiveError`. The narrow window is only
    dangerous while something is actively appending, so declining to touch a live
    session removes the condition rather than chasing the symptom.
