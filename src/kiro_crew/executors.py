"""Shared thread-pool executors for blocking maintenance work.

The asyncio event loop's *default* executor is also used by the loop itself
for ``getaddrinfo`` (DNS) and by every ``run_in_executor(None, ...)`` caller.
When long-running maintenance work (orphan-PID sweeps, cron subprocesses,
agent-overlay rewrites) piles onto that default pool it can saturate it and
starve the loop's own DNS resolution -- which is exactly the failure mode that
turns a brief network blip into a multi-second event-loop stall.

This module provides *separate*, bounded pools for that blocking work and also
names the loop's default executor's threads ``mc-default`` (Python's default
names them anonymously), so profilers like py-spy can attribute blocking work
to this gateway.

Three pools, deliberately split:

* :func:`maintenance_executor` -- the fast periodic sweeps (orphaned MCP/PID
  cleanup) and agent-overlay rewrites.  These are short and MUST stay
  responsive, because the orphan sweeps are what reap the leaked kiro-cli/MCP
  children whose mass death is the documented root cause of the loop wedge.
* :func:`subprocess_executor` -- per-process teardown work that can block on a
  *wedged kernel resource*: ``os.close`` on a PTY master fd whose far-end shell
  is in uninterruptible sleep, and the ``ps``/``pgrep`` spawns + ``os.kill``
  sweep in :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.client`.  These can hang indefinitely, so they
  get their OWN pool: a storm of wedged teardowns can occupy every worker here
  WITHOUT starving the :func:`maintenance_executor` orphan sweep that is the
  recovery action for the wedge (the bug the wedge fix would otherwise create
  by coupling the recovery mechanism to the same pool as the work that wedges).
* :func:`cron_executor` -- user cron command/script execution, which can run
  for minutes (``job.timeout`` defaults to 300s) and, because the scheduler
  dispatches every due job concurrently, can have several jobs in flight at
  once.  Keeping cron on its OWN pool means a burst of long-running cron jobs
  can never occupy all the maintenance threads and starve the sweeps.
* :func:`discovery_executor` -- browser-triggerable, read-only filesystem
  discovery for dashboard list endpoints (``GET /api/skills``,
  ``/api/agents/installed``, ``/api/prompts``): ``os.walk`` of skill/agent/SOP
  trees, per-file frontmatter reads, edition skill-root globs.  A large catalog
  one such scan take seconds, and a ``run_in_executor`` future cannot be
  cancelled once started, so N concurrent dashboard tabs would each pin a
  worker for the full scan.  This gets its OWN pool so those user-triggerable
  scans can never occupy the :func:`maintenance_executor` workers the orphan
  sweeps need to recover from a wedge.
* :func:`image_executor` -- Pillow decode/resize/encode for the MCP gateway's
  tool-result image budget (:mod:`kiro_crew.mcp_gateway.image_budget`).  Paced
  by whatever a brokered MCP server returns, and a single oversized raster
  costs a full decode plus up to seven resize+encode passes -- seconds of CPU.
  Same rationale as :func:`discovery_executor`: externally-paced, seconds-long
  work gets its OWN small pool so a burst of screenshots queues among ITSELF
  and can never occupy the :func:`maintenance_executor` workers the orphan
  sweeps need to recover from a wedge.
* :func:`stt_executor` -- in-process speech-to-text inference
  (:mod:`kiro_crew.stt.engine`, which loads the model here and decodes on it).
  A warm decode is tens of milliseconds, but a model load is seconds and the
  first ever load also compiles a GPU pipeline.  It cannot share
  :func:`subprocess_executor`: a ``run_in_executor`` future cannot be
  cancelled, so a wedged model load would hold one of the eight PTY-teardown
  workers indefinitely -- and those exist precisely so a teardown storm has
  somewhere to go.  A caller that gives up on a timeout does NOT free the
  thread, which is the whole reason this work needs a pool it can only starve
  for itself.

Long-term direction: this blocking work should move into a dedicated
supervised process (the VS Code extension-host model), so a wedge there cannot
touch the dashboard event loop at all.  These bounded pools are the in-process
containment until that process split lands.

# gate that outlives the wake deadline is never useful -- the deadline kills the
# run regardless, and the caller then cannot tell starvation from an overrun.

# starvation is indistinguishable from an overrun, which is how an undispatched
# one-shot gets consumed.  Removing the floor instead is the opposite error: the
# gate would get 0.25s at a 2s budget and could time out on a HEALTHY pool,
# converting a job that would have run into a never-started one.  Both failures
# are silent and point opposite ways, so keep the floor for budgets that can

# How the gate's single budget is DIVIDED between waiting for a worker and

# *timeout* is charged to EXECUTION alone -- so passing one value to both spends
# it twice and lets the gate run for 2x it.  The budget is already
# :func:`cron_gate_budget`, sized to land strictly below the wake deadline, so a
# gate that outran it put the DEADLINE first and neither phase bound was ever
# reached: nothing raised, the caller's retention handler never ran, and a
# one-shot was consumed by a run that never dispatched.  The two shares
# therefore sum to exactly 1.0 and no more.
#
# Weighted toward EXECUTION deliberately.  Queueing is the cheap phase -- gates
# queue only behind other gates, which the schedule paces, so a healthy claim
# costs microseconds and the queue bound binds only under starvation.  Execution
# is the useful work, and starving it is the OPPOSITE failure with an opposite
# symptom: a claimed gate cut off near zero raises :class:`CronGateTimeout`, a

# recording start while one finishes; more would let concurrent dictations OOM a

    pool's queue having run no code at all -- yet ``asyncio.wait_for`` starts
    its stopwatch the moment it is awaited.  Timing the whole await therefore
    spends the job's own budget on queue wait and kills jobs that never ran a
    line, reporting them as if the job itself had overrun.

    So wait for a worker to actually pick the call up FIRST, untimed by
    *timeout*, and only then apply *timeout* to the execution.  A job delayed
    by transient contention now runs instead of dying.

    The two phases fail differently, which is the other half of the point: a
    pool starved for the whole *queue_timeout* raises
    :class:`CronQueueTimeout` (``queued Ns, never ran``) rather than
    masquerading as N separate jobs that each overran.

    A call a worker claims right AT the deadline is routed to the execution
    phase rather than reported as a queue timeout.  It really did get a worker,
    and a thread cannot be interrupted, so calling it "never ran" would both
    misreport it and free the caller to start an overlapping run beside the one
    still executing.

    *queue_timeout* defaults to :data:`_CRON_QUEUE_WAIT_SECS`.  It is
    deliberately NOT derived from *timeout*: a 30s job behind a wedged worker
    should wait well past 30s and then run, not be killed on its own clock for
    something it did not do.

    *executor* defaults to :func:`cron_executor`.  It exists so the fire-time
    gate can reuse this two-phase discipline on its own pool
    (:func:`run_in_cron_gate_pool`) rather than carry a second copy of it: only

    the budget and then running is the outcome you want.  Here the gate is

    bound fire first, so the run is reported as never-started and retained.

    A quarter of the budget leaves the remaining three quarters for the dispatch
    the gate is a precondition for.

    The result is STRICTLY below *wake_budget* for every positive budget, which

    * the gate does not share a pool with externally-paced inbound traffic, so
      an inbound burst cannot put a FIFO backlog ahead of it; and
    * the wait is BOUNDED, raising :class:`CronQueueTimeout` when the gate never
      got a worker, which is the signal the callers translate into a
      retention marker so an undispatched one-shot is not consumed.

    *timeout* is the gate's TOTAL, split across the two phases by
    :data:`_CRON_GATE_QUEUE_SHARE` rather than handed to each of them: for a
    policy check there is no equivalent of "wait a long time, then run" -- a
    verdict that arrives after the wake deadline is worthless either way -- and
    ``run_in_cron_pool`` charges *timeout* to EXECUTION alone, so giving it to
    both bounds spent the budget twice and let the gate outlive the very deadline
    it was sized to stay inside.  Abandoning a CLAIMED gate is safe in a way
    abandoning a claimed command is not: the gate dispatches no job work, so
    nothing duplicates.  The residual is audit noise only -- a gate thread that
    completes after we stopped waiting may still emit its SEL
    ``governance_decision`` for a run that then did not dispatch.

    Which exception surfaces matters, because the callers key the retention
    marker off it.  ``run_in_cron_pool`` raises :class:`CronQueueTimeout` for the
    queue phase but a PLAIN :class:`asyncio.TimeoutError` for the execution
    phase, so a gate that got a worker and then overran its bound bypassed the
    callers' ``except CronQueueTimeout`` entirely and its one-shot was consumed.
    The execution bound is therefore re-raised as :class:`CronGateTimeout`, a
    subclass, so it reaches that handler.  A timeout raised from INSIDE the
    gate's own work is wrapped as :class:`CronGateWorkTimeout` in the worker
    thread first, so it can never be mistaken for this bound -- that one is a
