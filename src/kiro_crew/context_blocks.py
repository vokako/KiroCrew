"""Classify an assembled agent prompt into the blocks KiroCrew injected.

The assembly in :mod:`kiro_crew.context` appends ~30 separately-sourced strings
into one prompt. Attributing size back to those sources by instrumenting every
append site would put a counter next to each one and drift the moment a new
block is added without its counter. Instead this module classifies the FINAL
string by the bracket markers the assembly already emits — the markers are a
contract with the model, so they are stable, and reading the output means the
attribution cannot disagree with what was actually sent.

Anything not matched lands in ``unclassified``, so a new (or renamed) block
shows up as a visible bucket instead of being silently folded into a neighbour.

Sizes are characters, not tokens. Characters are exact, free, and deterministic;
the only tokenizer available here is OpenAI's BPE, which would add a systematic
unknown error against a Claude backend. For comparing one turn against another —
the point of the breakdown — an exact unit beats an approximate one.

    the turn after a rewriting hook, marker neutralization and the multibyte fold
    have all been applied). Pass it whenever it is available: the ``user_chars`` /

    ``user_chars`` is the length of the user's own text as appended (the caller
    knows it exactly; parsing it back out of the prompt would be guesswork
    because the text is neutralized, not delimited). It is subtracted from the
    request-header span, which is the block the user's text sits inside.

    the message region (a cancelled-turn preamble, subagent-failure notices,
    drained pending context). Those bytes are injected context, not user typing,
