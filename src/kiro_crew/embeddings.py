"""In-process embedding runtime and model download manager.

Embeddings run in-process via the vendored llama-cpp-python runtime
(``kiro_crew/_vendor``) — no external Ollama server, no HTTP hop, no
runtime pip install. The Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B GGUF model is downloaded in
the background (sha256-verified, with retries) and installed persistently
to ``~/.kiro/crew/models/``. Sources are tried in order: a byte-identical
blob salvaged from a legacy Ollama install, then the public CloudFront CDN
(plain HTTPS — no git access, no cloud SDK). ``KIROCREW_EMBED_MODEL_URL``
(or the ``memory.embed_model_url`` config knob) overrides the CDN URL for
mirrored/airgapped deployments.

A user-supplied model can be run instead of the bundled one by pointing
``KIROCREW_EMBED_MODEL_PATH`` (or ``memory.embed_model_path``) at a local
GGUF. In that mode the default model is never downloaded or installed, so a
custom model survives a default-model version bump. Changing the model also
changes the vector space, so stored embeddings are re-generated automatically
— see :func:`embedding_space_signature`.

While the model file is absent (first boot, download in flight, or a
failed download) every embed call returns ``None`` and memory degrades
gracefully to keyword/FTS search — the existing lazy-rebind machinery in
``vector_memory._try_embed`` picks embeddings up automatically once the
model lands, no gateway restart required.

# 16-core host EVERY embed, even an 8-character one, fanned out across all 16
# cores and measured ~4.5 cores sustained inside the gateway. A 0.6B model over
# short text does not need that, and oversubscribing the box makes the pool both
# suffer and cause contention. Pinned low here, overridable via

# indistinguishable from a runaway process to the user — laptop fans spin up and
# stay up — even though every row is legitimate work.
#
# Nobody is waiting on that work. A row with a NULL embedding is still FTS5
# keyword-searchable the moment it lands; the sweep only adds SEMANTIC reach over
# memories the user imported from a previous install. So the sweep is optimized
# for staying invisible, not for finishing early, and the defaults below are
# deliberately slow: one thread at a 20% duty cycle is ~0.2 of a core, which no
# fan reacts to. On the measured host that is ~7 s/row, so a 3,000-row backlog
# takes hours — and that is fine. It is idempotent and resumes across restarts
# (an unfinished row stays NULL and the next boot picks it up), so a machine that

    Successful results are cached via ``functools.lru_cache`` keyed by input
    text AND the producing backend's ``model_id`` — after a backend swap
    (:func:`register_embedding_backend` + :func:`reset_shared_embedder`) the
    old model's cached vectors can never be served for the new model, which
    would silently mix incomparable vector spaces. Bounded to
    ``_EMBED_CACHE_MAX`` entries (see constant for size math). Failures
    (None) are not cached so a still-downloading model is retried. Embedding
    never blocks on the model load (kicked in the background); callers get
    ``None`` until the model is resident.
