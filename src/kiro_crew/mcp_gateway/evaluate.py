"""Run the pre-flight for servers whose verdict is missing or stale, and cache it.

This is the orchestration the layers below deliberately do not do: ``preflight``
knows how to provoke one server, ``verdict_cache`` knows how to remember, and
``shareability`` knows how to judge. This module decides WHICH servers are worth
paying for, which is a policy question and belongs in one place.

The policy: evaluate only what changed. A server whose execution identity
already has a cached verdict is skipped, so the steady-state cost of the whole
feature is a file read. A newly installed or upgraded MCP costs two spawns,
once.

Never called while rendering anything. The pre-flight spawns processes, so this
runs from the explicit probe action the operator already triggers — the same
action that already spawns every configured server.

    Stored inside the server's row rather than used as its key, so one server

    adding a second row.

    Env is hashed by the same helper the pool uses, so the rotating-secret
    exclusions apply — a credential rotation must not look like a different
    server here either.

    It deliberately does NOT pass ``identity_keys``, so a variable an operator
    named in ``mcp_gateway.pool_identity_env`` still does not enter THIS hash.
    The pool needs the value in its key because the value decides which backend
    is the right backend; a measurement is a claim about the server's BEHAVIOUR,
    and rotating a credential does not change that. Folding it in here would
    discard a good measurement on every rotation, which is the stale-verdict
    failure this identity exists to prevent, in reverse. So the two hashes agree
    on the default set and diverge only on named keys, on purpose.

    ``binary_version`` fingerprints everything the launch actually runs, not just
    the executable. Most MCP servers are launched THROUGH an interpreter —
    ``python server.py``, ``node server.js`` — so fingerprinting ``command``
    alone identifies the interpreter, which does not change when the server's own
    code is edited in place. The argv entries that resolve to real files are
    fingerprinted too, so editing the script invalidates the verdict the way
    replacing a compiled binary does. Without that, the most common shape of MCP
    server keeps a stale measurement for ever: a server that BECAME
    caller-sensitive would ship its first caller's ``initialize`` result to
    everyone else, which is the outcome this identity exists to prevent.

    *servers* are ``McpServerInfo`` objects. Returns name -> verdict for every
    server that has one, stored or freshly derived, so a caller can render
    without a second lookup.

    *budget* caps how many servers are measured in this pass. ``None`` lifts the
    cap, which is for an operator who explicitly asked to measure everything and
    is watching progress — never for a request that renders a page, where an
    uncapped pass would spawn two processes per configured server while somebody
    waits. *on_progress* is called with ``(measured, attempted, total)`` after
    each measurement so that caller can report where it is; it runs on the event
    loop, so it must not block.

    ``measured`` and ``attempted`` are separate because they answer different
    questions and routinely disagree. A server whose pre-flight could not run --
    a missing credential, an unreachable tunnel, a host where the probe cannot
    spawn at all -- was attempted and produced no verdict, so it is still
    unmeasured afterwards. Reporting one number for both is what let a pass that
    measured nothing close with "Measured 30 servers" beside a table still
    showing thirty unmeasured rows. ``attempted`` is what a progress bar has to
    advance on, or it would sit at zero for the whole pass; ``measured`` is what
    a claim about the outcome has to be built from.

    Nothing is deleted here. One server owns one row, so a row is replaced by its
    own server's next measurement and by nothing else — there is no inventory to
    compare against and no size to bound. That matters because the only caller's
    list comes from ``probe_all``, which excludes consent-disabled rows by design:
    any rule that deleted "servers not in this list" would discard the valid
    measurement of every disabled server.

    Every filesystem touch here is offloaded: this runs inside a request handler
    on the gateway's event loop, and a slow disk would otherwise stall every chat
    sharing that loop, not just this probe.

    One pass runs at a time, and a BUDGETED pass does not queue behind an uncapped
    one. An uncapped operator pass runs for minutes; the budgeted caller is a
    request somebody is waiting on, and waiting for the lock would hold its
    already-computed response for the whole pass. A budgeted call therefore takes
    the lock only if it is free and otherwise returns what is already stored.
    Nothing is lost by yielding: the caller's own cap means it was only ever going
    to measure a couple of servers, "not measured yet" is a state it already
    renders, and the uncapped pass holding the lock is measuring the same servers
    anyway.
