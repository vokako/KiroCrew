"""Gateway-side handler for the MCP Apps UI→tool callback path (``app-call``).

An embedded MCP App iframe cannot talk to its MCP server directly — the
dashboard exposes ``POST /api/mcp-apps/call``, which relays the request to
gatewayd as a one-shot ``app-call`` control frame on the uid-gated unix
socket (same trust basis as ``claim``/``abort``). This module implements the
gateway side:

1. **Capability token** — the frame carries only an opaque ``spool_id``. The
   gateway re-reads its OWN spool record (written at interception time) to
   recover ``{server, session_key}``; a caller that cannot name a live spool
   id gets nothing. No server names or session keys are trusted from the
   HTTP layer.
2. **Visibility enforcement** — the target tool's ``_meta.ui.visibility`` in the
   backend's ``tools/list`` must admit the ``"app"`` audience (fetched FRESH per
   call — an authorization input is never cached, so a server-side visibility
   revocation takes effect immediately). Per SEP-1865 ``visibility`` defaults to
   ``["model", "app"]``, so a tool that declares nothing IS app-callable; only an
   explicit declaration excluding ``"app"``, or one this host cannot parse, is
   refused.
3. **Argument validation** — the iframe-controlled ``arguments`` are
   validated against the tool's declared ``inputSchema`` (fail-closed; see
   :func:`kiro_crew.validation.validate_mcp_tool_arguments`) before any
   payload can reach the backend.
4. **Governance** — the canonical ``@server/tool`` reference is resolved
   against the governance ceiling ∩ active profile (``mcp`` scope), the same
   decision Plane A applies to model calls. Evaluation errors DENY.
5. **Forward** — the ``tools/call`` is forwarded through the normal
   ``forward_from_stub`` seam on an ephemeral stub, with a
   :class:`CallerContext` of ``session_type="mcp-app"`` so backends (and the
   SEL audit trail) can distinguish app-originated calls from model calls.

Every decision (allow or deny) is SEL-audited — this is a brand-new
UI-originated tool-invocation path and deserves the same trail as ``claim``.
