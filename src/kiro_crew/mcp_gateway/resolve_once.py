"""Resolve an npm-launcher MCP command once, then launch the resolved tree.

An ``npx``-style spec re-resolves its dependency tree on every launch: npm asks
the registry what the spec means, walks the tree, and rewrites its lockfile. That
puts a network round trip and a full resolution pass on the session-start path,
where a slow or unreachable registry becomes an unbounded stall and where the
resolution's own cost grows with the cache's history.

This module moves that work off the launch path. A resolved tree lives under
``<data home>/mcp/resolved/<digest>/`` beside a :class:`ResolvedRecord`; launching
then means ``exec``-ing the recorded entry point with no npm involvement at all.

Two properties the design holds to:

* **The lookup is synchronous and cheap.** ``resolved_launch`` is called on the
  spawn path (``TargetResolver`` is a sync callable), so it only ever reads a
  small JSON file. Installing is somebody else's job, done ahead of time.
* **A miss is not a failure.** No record, an unreadable record, or a tree whose
  entry point has gone missing all return ``None``, and the caller falls back to
  the original ``npx`` invocation. The feature can only remove a stall, never
  introduce one.

Freshness follows the spec's own promise. A spec pinned to an exact version means
the same tree forever, so it is resolved once and never revisited. An unpinned
spec (``@latest``, a range, or no version at all) is asked to keep up with
upstream, so its record expires and is re-resolved -- on a clock rather than on
every single launch. The clock is ticked by a periodic pass in the gateway, not
only at boot, because a gateway that stays up for weeks would otherwise freeze an
unpinned spec at whatever it resolved to on the day it started.

Substitution is deliberately narrow, because a hit that runs the WRONG program
would be worse than never substituting at all: the record is only written when
``npx`` would unambiguously pick the same file (see :func:`_bin_relpath`) and
when ``node`` is the right way to start it (see :func:`_is_node_runnable`).
Anything else misses.

One divergence from ``npx`` remains and is accepted: ``npx`` puts the tree's
``node_modules/.bin`` on ``PATH``, so a server that shells out to a SIBLING
package's binary by bare name finds it there and would not here. It is not
fixable in the resolver wrapper: env is passed through exactly as the inner
resolver computed it so the ``PoolKey``'s env hash keeps describing what is
actually spawned, and rewriting ``PATH`` would break that. MCP servers are stdio
node processes and rarely do this, but a server that does needs its own spec left
unresolved.

A second limitation is open and deliberately NOT papered over. The store is filled
by the gateway's own ``npm`` with the gateway's own environment, so a server whose
DECLARED env points npm somewhere else -- a private registry, a token, a different
toolchain -- could be handed a tree resolved from the wrong place. The check cannot
live on the read side: the resolver is synchronous and the env it receives is
``_scrub_sensitive_env(dict(os.environ))``, a full inherited environment that
cannot be told apart from a server's declarations, while the real per-server
declarations (``gatewayd._declared_env_pairs``) require a config load and a file
read that its own docstring forbids on the event loop. Closing it properly belongs
on the write side, where the prefetcher may do I/O and can decline a spec whose
servers declare an npm-affecting env -- which needs the rewriter to surface those
declarations. Until then, an operator running MCP servers against a private
registry should not rely on this path.
