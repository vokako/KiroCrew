"""Provoke, before any user is served, the failure that sharing would cause.

Waiting for a shared backend to misbehave means a real session pays: the
affected chat loses that server's tools until it is reopened. This module
anticipates instead. It asks the question the pool will ask later — "does this
server behave the same for every caller?" — while nobody is attached.

The check that matters, and why it is decidable
----------------------------------------------
``Backend`` caches the first stub's ``initialize`` result and replays it to every
later stub, and its own docstring says the MCP spec does not require a server to
answer ``initialize`` the same way twice: a server that negotiates capabilities
from ``clientInfo`` would silently hand session B session A's capability set.
That is documented there as an assumption the gateway cannot verify at runtime.

It IS verifiable offline. Spawn the server twice under two different
``clientInfo`` identities and compare every facet the backend replays: the
advertised capabilities, the negotiated protocol version, the server's own
identification, and the ``tools/list`` answer. Divergence on any of them is
proof of caller sensitivity; agreement is strong evidence against it. Two
sequential spawns, no broker, no synthetic co-tenancy.

Which facet diverged is logged and carried in ``detail`` for diagnosis, but the
verdict is one boolean: every consumer of a stored measurement reduces it to
"caller sensitive or not", so reporting the facet to an operator would be a
change to that whole path rather than to this module.

Why the tool list is part of it
------------------------------
The tool list is mandatory in every revision of the protocol, while tool
ANNOTATIONS only exist from MCP 2025-03-26. Comparing the list is therefore the
one facet that is decidable on a server too old to describe its own tools — the
servers most likely to predate any thought of co-tenancy. The probe already
issues ``tools/list`` and stores the answer, so this costs no extra spawn and no
extra request; the earlier shape of this module simply discarded it.

What this does NOT catch, on purpose
------------------------------------
State that only appears after real work (a server that starts keying on the
caller only once someone authenticates), and behaviour that needs genuine
concurrency. Those stay the ``hazards`` ledger's job — which is why the ledger
outranks anything decided here rather than being a fallback for it.

Cost
----
Two spawns per evaluated server, and only for servers whose execution identity
changed (see ``verdict_cache``). Never on the request path: probing spawns
processes, and this module is called from an explicit action or a background
pass, never while rendering a page.

    The probe already pays for this round-trip and stores the result, so widening
    the comparison here costs no extra spawn and no extra request. It is what
    makes the check decidable on a server that sends no annotations at all: the
    tool LIST is mandatory in every MCP revision, so a server too old to carry
    ``readOnlyHint`` is still fully measurable on this facet.

    Two projections keep ordering out of the comparison, because a pooled backend
    replays the cached answer and a server free to enumerate its tools in a
    different order each spawn is not thereby caller-sensitive:

    * names become a SET — a different set is a real divergence, a different
      order is not;
    * annotation shapes become a sorted MULTISET, never paired with a name.

    That second projection is deliberately unpaired, and this is the load-bearing
    part. The prober builds ``tools`` and ``tool_annotations`` in two comprehensions
    over the same list with INDEPENDENT predicates — a tool is kept in ``tools``
    when its name is truthy, and in ``tool_annotations`` when it carries an
    ``annotations`` dict. Neither list records which tool an entry came from, so a
    tool with an empty name but an annotation object is dropped from one and kept in
    the other: the two lists can be the same LENGTH and still describe different
    tools. Any attempt to re-establish alignment on this side of the wire is
    therefore guessing, whether it pairs by index or first checks the lengths.

    So the alignment question is removed rather than answered. Comparing the
    shapes as an unordered multiset still detects the thing this facet exists to
    detect — a server that makes a different annotation claim to the second caller
    changes the multiset — while a reorder, a partial list, and a mismatched filter
    all become unobservable instead of becoming a wrong verdict. Per-tool
    attribution is not lost, because nothing consumed it: one reason code covers
    every facet, and no caller reads which tool diverged.

    Each shape is canonicalised to a JSON string before sorting. The projection
    yields dicts, and ordering dicts directly would raise ``TypeError`` — the same
    crash class this module already guards against for tool names.

    Annotation VALUES are compared through the same shape projection as
    capabilities: what matters is that the server made the same claim to both
    callers, and a free-form leaf it varies per spawn is not that claim.
