"""Asyncio unix-socket server for the KiroCrew MCP gateway.

This module is the entry point for ``python -m
kiro_crew.mcp_gateway.gatewayd`` and for in-process use by
:class:`kiro_crew.mcp_gateway.manager.GatewayManager`.
The daemon wires the full bidirectional JSON-RPC pump on top of the
register skeleton:

* Register handshake (unchanged from M1) produces the :class:`PoolKey`.
* First non-register message triggers a lazy backend spawn through
  :meth:`BackendPool.get_or_create` — concurrent stubs with the same key
  share one backend, with spawn-dedup handled inside the pool.
* Stub→gateway pump reads line-delimited JSON-RPC and forwards through
  :meth:`Backend.forward_from_stub`, which handles id rewriting, caller-
  identity injection, and initialize caching.
* Gateway→stub pump drains the per-stub inbox queue populated by the
  backend's stdout task.
* Handshake phase has a timeout; the bridge phase is NOT timeout-wrapped
  (learned correction — a single timeout around the bridge silently kills
  healthy long-lived sessions).

Graceful shutdown: setting the ``stop_event`` stops accepts, drains
in-flight connection handlers up to ``_SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_SECS``, shuts the
pool down, and unlinks the socket before return. SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers
installed by the caller should just forward into ``stop_event.set()``.

    This is used ONLY when ``python -m kiro_crew.mcp_gateway.gatewayd`` is
    invoked without an explicit ``--socket`` flag — a rare operator path,
    typically ad-hoc debugging. The KiroCrew production path always
    derives the socket from ``McpGatewayConfig.socket_path`` / the
    ``default_socket_path()`` in :mod:`kiro_crew.mcp_gateway.rewriter`,
    which returns ``$KIROCREW_HOME/mcp-gateway/gateway.sock``.

    Preference order for this CLI fallback:
    1. ``$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/kirocrew/mcp-gateway.sock`` when XDG is set.
    2. ``$KIROCREW_HOME``/config-dir ``/mcp-gateway/mcp-gateway.sock``.

    There is deliberately no ``/tmp`` tier. ``XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`` is unset on
    Windows, so a ``/tmp`` fallback would resolve against the current drive and
    have the daemon create a stray ``C:\\tmp`` for its lock file. The data-home

        socket_path: Absolute path for the unix socket. Parent directories
            are created if missing; a stale socket left by a prior crash
            is removed before bind.
        max_backends: Pool capacity. When the pool is full and a new key
            arrives, :meth:`BackendPool.get_or_create` evicts the least-
            recently-used idle entry before spawning the new one.
        idle_timeout_secs: A backend whose stubs have all detached and
            whose ``last_used_at`` is older than this is evicted by the
            idle sweeper (runs every ``idle_timeout_secs / 4``, minimum
            500 ms).
        stop_event: Caller-owned event. Setting it triggers graceful
            shutdown: accept loop exits, in-flight handlers get
            ``_SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_SECS`` to finish, then everything cancels,
            the pool shuts down, and the socket is unlinked.
        target_resolver: Callable mapping :class:`PoolKey` to the spawn
            4-tuple ``(command, args, env, work_dir)``. Pass ``None`` to
            use the default :func:`env_target_resolver`. Tests supply a
            custom resolver to avoid coupling to environment variables.
        prewarm_count: Number of hottest observed PoolKeys to spawn at
            startup before the first stub connects, closing the
            cold-after-restart / cold-after-idle new-chat latency gap. The
            list of hot keys is learned from prior registers and persisted
            beside the socket in ``hot-keys.json``. ``0`` (default) disables
            prewarming entirely — no file is read or written, no extra task
            runs. Clamped to ``max_backends - 1`` if set at or above pool
            capacity, since prewarmed backends are pinned and would otherwise
            leave no reclaimable slot for a live, non-warm session.
        credential_watch_paths: Credential files to watch for content
            changes. On a real rotation (content digest change — a no-op
            rewrite with identical bytes never fires), ALL pooled backends
            are drained via a blue-green cutover so they respawn with the

# it. Backends then accumulate for the lifetime of the daemon.
#

# so the death has no way to surface. ``_drain_inbox_to_stub`` already handles
# the write error correctly — it simply never gets a frame to write.
