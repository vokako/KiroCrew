"""Warm-pool prewarming for the KiroCrew MCP gateway.

The gateway spawns a backend lazily on a stub's first non-register frame
(:func:`gatewayd._acquire_backend`). That lazy path costs a full
spawn + ``initialize`` round-trip — tens to hundreds of ms — on the
*first* new-chat after the daemon (re)starts or after every backend has
idled out. Repeated new-chats inside ``idle_timeout_secs`` already hit a
warm backend; only the cold-after-restart / cold-after-idle case is slow.

Prewarming closes that gap by spawning the most-used backends *before*
the first stub connects, so their PoolKeys are already in the pool and a
matching stub register short-circuits straight to the warm backend.

Two halves, both deliberately cheap on the event loop:

* **Observation** — :class:`HotKeyStore` keeps an in-memory hit count per
  PoolKey, updated on every register (O(1), zero IO — recording must
  never block the loop). A periodic flush task persists the counts to
  ``hot-keys.json`` via ``asyncio.to_thread`` so the on-loop path stays
  IO-free.
* **Prewarm** — at startup :func:`prewarm_from_payloads` reads the top-N
  persisted register payloads, rebuilds each :class:`PoolKey` via
  :meth:`PoolKey.from_register`, and spawns the backend through the same
  ``acquire`` callable the live path uses, so a prewarmed backend is
  byte-identical to a lazily-spawned one.

A PoolKey carries no channel dimension (see :mod:`kiro_crew.mcp_gateway.pool`),
so a hot key is not tied to one conversation surface: a backend prewarmed from
an observed key is hit by every later session that matches on agent, server and
the execution/security dimensions, whichever channel it arrives from.
Prewarming by observed hot key is therefore sound without any shared-fallback
path.
