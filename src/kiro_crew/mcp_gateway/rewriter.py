"""Rewrite kiro agent JSON so MCP servers route through the broker.

The rewriter reads ``~/.kiro/agents/*.json`` and writes modified copies into
the overlay directory (``<config_dir>/mcp-gateway/agents/``). The host
filesystem remains untouched — the broker stubs in these specs are injected
into each kiro-cli session over ACP ``session/new``, which outranks the
same-named entry in the agent spec (see ``session_servers.py``).

Servers in :data:`UNPOOLABLE_SERVERS` are left unwrapped. The set is empty, so
nothing is excluded through it; the first-party servers that bind
``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` stay unwrapped only because nothing lists them in the
stub allowlist.

The rewrite is fingerprint-cached: a content-signature snapshot of every input is
kept at ``<overlay_dir>/.rewrite-fingerprint``, and a boot whose inputs all
match serves the previous run's overlays (and its cached ``target_env``)
instead of re-parsing, re-resolving and re-writing everything. The prune
pass runs on both paths. Any doubt — torn file, missing output, unresolved
command — falls through to the full rewrite.

    removed from, added to, or shadowed within an unchanged PATH), so the

    ``env_placeholder_seen`` records that a declared env contained a

    Used to decide whether a previous overlay may be KEPT on a pass that cannot
    establish the injection set. Keeping one defers every input that overlay
    encodes, not only the injection: the agent's own spec (an ``autoApprove``
    entry removed, a server disabled) and the policy knobs
    ``_build_stub_entry`` bakes into each stub's argv (``--sandbox-mode``,
    ``--approval-mode``, ``--poolable``, the work dir, the socket, the identity
    keys). A revocation or a tightened policy is a deliberate instruction and
    must not wait for the next boot, so a keep is only honest when nothing it
    would defer has changed.

    The settings entry is the ONE input compared conditionally, and only because
    a transient fault is what makes it unanswerable: ``_rewrite_inputs_fingerprint``
    signs that file with ``_stat_sig``, which returns ``None`` when it cannot be
    read, and that ``None`` is why control reaches the rewrite loop instead of the
    cached early return. So it is skipped when this pass could not sign the file --
    demanding a match there would refuse every keep on exactly the path this
    protects. When the signature IS available and differs, the file demonstrably
    changed and the keep is refused: read_text and read_bytes are separate calls,
    so a fault can hit one and not the other, and a settings revocation kept alive
    by a stale injected entry is an absorbed instruction, not a deferred edit.
    Every other input is compared unconditionally, so a new fingerprinted input is
    covered without being enumerated here.

    ``False`` whenever the answer cannot be established: no stored fingerprint
    (one is unlinked at the end of every uncacheable pass, so two consecutive

    tampered or edited artifact must be regenerated, not served) and re-asserts
    owner-only protection on each one, because a chmod or DACL edit changes no
    size, mtime or digest and so is invisible to a signature. A keep must offer
    the same guarantees or it becomes a way to have a tampered overlay served,
    and a loosened sidecar ACL left unrepaired, by inducing one transient fault.

    This covers the pass-wide set: the env sidecar directory, every recorded

    points ``--env-file`` at those sidecars, the sidecar prune is skipped on this

    the cached ``(results, target_env)`` is returned; the stale-file prune
    still runs on that path.

    Args:
        source_dir: Usually ``~/.kiro/agents/``.
        overlay_dir: Usually ``<config_dir>/mcp-gateway/agents/``. Created
            if missing. Cleared of stale files not in ``source_dir``.
        socket_path: Absolute path to the gateway unix socket.
        work_dir: Default cwd passed to the stub (and used in PoolKey
            hashing). Created if missing; gatewayd sets it as the backend
            process's ``current_dir``.
        sandbox_mode: Value from ``config.agent.sandbox`` — fed through
            so the stub's PoolKey matches KiroCrew's sandbox policy.
        approval_mode: Value from ``config.agent.approval_mode`` — same.
        stub_servers: Server names from ``config.mcp_gateway.stub_servers``.
            A stdio server gets a stub when its name is in this set — that list is
            the ONLY trigger. A per-agent-spec ``poolable: true`` is retired and
            deliberately ignored here: both real gates (the broker start gate and
            the session overlay) read the config list, so honouring the spec key
            produced a stub nothing pointed at. It is still stripped before the
            entry reaches kiro-cli, and still reported as ``entry_poolable`` for
            information only. An unstubbed server is left untouched for the
            session to launch itself, which is what keeps the default free of both
            a daemon and a stub process. ``None`` is treated as an empty set,
            meaning nothing is rewritten at all.
        pooling_enabled: ``config.mcp_gateway.enabled``. Sharing is global over
            the stub set: when ``False`` no stub is marked shareable, so each
            connection gets its own backend while the stubs stay in place — the
            state that lets a stubbed server render UI without co-tenancy.

    Returns:
        A ``(results, target_env)`` tuple:

        * ``results``: mapping ``{agent_filename: wrapped_server_count}``.
          Agents with no MCP servers are omitted.
        * ``target_env``: mapping ``{KIROCREW_MCP_TARGET_<SERVER>: "cmd arg arg"}``
          suitable for ``GatewaySpec.mcp_target_env``. Gatewayd consults

          to spawn for a new pool key.
