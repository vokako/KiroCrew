"""PoolKey + BackendPool — the correctness-critical sharing boundary.

Two sessions sharing a single backend MUST produce the same answers as if
each had its own backend. Every attribute that changes backend behavior
MUST be in :class:`PoolKey`, or two sessions can see cross-tenant state.

The 12 dimensions captured below are the union of every spawn-time input
that influences a Kiro MCP subprocess: identity (``server_name``,
``agent_name``), execution (``command_args_hash``, ``effective_env_hash``,
``work_dir``, ``binary_version``), security (``os_uid``, ``sandbox_mode``,
``autoapprove_set_hash``, ``approval_mode``, ``trust_all_tools``), and
config drift (``config_snapshot_hash``).

There is deliberately NO channel dimension. A channel is not a trust
boundary and never was a usable proxy for one:

* It is not a consistent unit. On Slack a channel is a ROOM shared by many
  people, so two different humans in one channel landed on the same backend
  anyway — the isolation it advertised was never delivered. On Telegram the
  same field held a per-user id. A dimension whose meaning changes per
  transport cannot carry a security invariant.
* It over-partitions the common case. One person reaching the same agent
  from the dashboard and from a chat transport would burn a separate backend
  per surface, which is exactly the memory pooling exists to reclaim.
* It is redundant with a mechanism that already works. ``gatewayd`` stamps
  ``_meta.kirocrew.caller`` (session key, session type, principal, channel)
  onto every forwarded ``tools/call``, so a channel-aware backend learns the
  channel PER CALL and does not need a process to itself.

There is deliberately NO per-principal dimension either. Kiro Crew is
single-operator: a Slack bot and a cron job are the same operator's
automations, not separate principals, so a multi-principal shared gateway
is not a supported deployment model. A ``user_identity`` key field would be
a misleading affordance: nothing populates a ``KIROCREW_PRINCIPAL`` source,
so such a field collapses to the OS user and isolates nothing. The
cross-OS-user boundary that IS real is carried by ``os_uid``. If
multi-principal isolation is ever wanted, it needs a real design (what
counts as a principal on an unattended surface is the hard part); adding a
key field would be the small part.

Stable hashing uses SHA-256 over a JSON-serialized tuple with sorted keys.
Python's built-in ``hash()`` is intentionally non-deterministic across
processes (``PYTHONHASHSEED``) so it cannot be used for pool identity.
