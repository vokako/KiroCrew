"""Defense-in-depth helpers for the gatewayd local endpoint.

The endpoint carries every tool call and every tool result for every pooled
session, so two questions have to be answerable at accept time:

* **Is the peer the same principal as us?** :func:`check_peer_is_self` answers
  it deny-by-default -- ``MATCH`` only on positive confirmation, never as a
  consequence of a failed lookup.
* **Which process is on the other end?** :func:`get_peer_pid` answers it, and
  gatewayd uses the PID two ways: to walk the peer's real ancestry for a
  session-key file when a stub registers without one, and to index the
  connection under the peer's *host* PID chain so a later ``claim`` frame
  (which carries a host PID) lands on the right connection even when the
  stub's self-reported PIDs are namespace-local.

Both are per-platform mechanisms rather than one portable call:

===========  ====================================  =========================
Platform     Peer principal                        Peer PID
===========  ====================================  =========================
Linux        ``SO_PEERCRED`` uid                   ``SO_PEERCRED`` pid
Windows      owning-process token SID              ``GetNamedPipeClientProcessId``
macOS        ``LOCAL_PEERCRED`` xucred uid          ``LOCAL_PEERPID``
===========  ====================================  =========================

All three platforms now fail closed: every one of them is in
:data:`PEER_IDENTITY_SUPPORTED`, so an ``UNVERIFIABLE`` lookup is refused rather
than waved through. macOS was the last holdout, and the reason it waited is worth
keeping: turning failed lookups into refusals *before* a real Mac had answered
``MATCH`` is exactly how the Windows port shipped a gate that denied 100% of
connections while presenting as merely strict.

That evidence now exists, and it is enforced rather than merely observed. The
macOS CI job runs ``test_macos_check_matches_a_socket_we_connected_to_ourselves``
by node id and fails unless it PASSES, so the canary cannot quietly stop running
and leave this gate unproven. It deliberately exercises an *accepted* socket
(``transport.serve`` + ``connect``) rather than a socketpair, because the kernel
populates peer credentials by different paths for the two: ``UNP_HAVEPC`` is set
at ``connect()``, while an accepted socket takes the listener's cached cred. A
passing socketpair therefore would not have implied a passing endpoint.

The residual risk is bounded by the stub, not by this module. When gatewayd
refuses a connection the stub's handshake raises ``FallbackRequestedError`` and
it then ``execvpe`` the target backend directly, appending a record to
``stub_fallback.jsonl``. So a ``LOCAL_PEERCRED`` failure on some Mac
configuration costs pooling and leaves an audit trail; it does not break the
session. :func:`socket_owner_only` consequently guards no supported platform's
admission path -- it is the fallback for a POSIX platform that has
neither ``SO_PEERCRED`` nor Darwin's option.

Stdlib-only (``socket``, ``struct``, ``ctypes``, ``os``, ``logging``) plus the
``platform_compat`` leaf; no asyncio imports, so this module is safe to call
from synchronous setup paths (:func:`run_gatewayd` startup) as well as from
async connection handlers.
