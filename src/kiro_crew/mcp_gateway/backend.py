"""Backend subprocess lifecycle for pooled MCP servers.

A :class:`Backend` is one real MCP subprocess (e.g. a ``slack-mcp`` launcher) the gateway spawned on behalf of one or more stubs. It owns
stdin/stdout pipes, tracks whether the backend's ``initialize`` response
advertised the ``kirocrew.caller-identity`` capability (pooled operation),
and exposes a graceful shutdown path that escalates to ``SIGKILL`` after a
deadline.

Milestone 1 scope: spawn, handshake via ``initialize``, graceful shutdown.
JSON-RPC fan-out routing and per-call identity injection live in
Milestone 3 when the full bridge ships.

    Capability follows the STUB, not a new preference. This function only ever

    broker for a server the operator stubbed, so the opt-in has already happened
    by the time control is here. That is why there is no *forward-facing* apps
    switch any more: a preference could not grant the feature (with no stub there
    is no render or callback path to grant).

    What survives is the two ways an operator can still say **no**:

    1. ``KIROCREW_MCP_APPS`` off -> disabled. Absolute kill switch, for tests,
       the e2e harness, and an operator who wants a stubbed server's backend
       shared without its server-authored UI.
    2. A stored ``mcp_gateway.apps_enabled = false`` -> disabled, EVEN with the
       env flag on. This key is retired going forward — nothing writes it, the
       MCP Management page does not surface it, and the docs do not teach it —
       but a released version honoured it as a trustworthy opt-out, so a config
       that already carries ``false`` keeps its opt-out. Dropping it here would
       silently start executing server-authored UI for the one operator who took
       the trouble to turn it off. It defaults True when absent, so this fires
       only on a value someone actually wrote: "not configured" is not an opt-out.

    The released gate had a third leg — it also required ``mcp_gateway.enabled``,
    because back then the broker existed only when sharing was on. That leg is
    deliberately gone, and it costs no released behaviour: under the current
    migration ``enabled: false`` resolves to an EMPTY stub set, so no stub, no
    backend, and this gate never runs for such an install.

    Fails CLOSED: if config cannot be read, the feature is disabled. An
    unreadable config in gatewayd is an abnormal state, and silently disabling an
    optional rendering feature is the low-harm outcome versus rendering against
    an operator preference we could not confirm.

           Every entry is keyed by a gateway-minted ``_next_forward_id()`` frame

           does the out-of-band ``resources/read`` + spool write + delivery in a

           task drains that queue onto the stub socket. Between those two steps

        1. Initialize caching — only the first stub's ``initialize`` reaches
           the backend. Later stubs receive the cached result locally so
           the backend state machine does not see a double-initialize.
        2. Id rewriting — the stub's id is replaced with a gateway-scoped
           monotonic id. The mapping survives in ``_pending_requests`` so
           the stdout pump can put the original id back on the response.
        3. Caller-identity injection — ``tools/call`` requests get a
           ``params._meta.kirocrew.caller`` block when the backend
           advertised the capability at initialize time. The block is
           built via :func:`kiro_crew.mcp_caller.build_caller_meta` so
           gateway + backend share exactly one wire format.

        ``tenant_nonce`` is this CONNECTION's namespace separator, injected
        alongside (3) and independently of it: a caller the gateway cannot name
        gets no identity block but still gets a nonce, which is what keeps two
        unnamed co-tenants of one pooled backend out of each other's per-tenant
        state. Empty means "no separator available" and leaves the

        Routing grants are recorded on the server's RESPONSE, never at
        forward time, so the table only ever names stubs whose subscription
        the server actually accepted (fail-closed: an update racing the

          gets its own upstream authorization decision — no local coalescing
          on the subscribe side (``_on_resource_subscription_response``

        - An identity-less server sees every co-tenant as one principal, so
          duplicate traffic tells it nothing; only lease TRANSITIONS reach
          it. The first subscriber's subscribe takes the lease; a stub
          arriving while that grant is in flight is PARKED and answered with
          the server's actual verdict, never a premature success; a stub
          arriving after the grant joins locally with the MCP empty result
          (exactly as the initialize cache answers later stubs). A non-final
          unsubscribe is answered locally; the final one is forwarded and the
          routing entry is kept until the server confirms, because a failed
          unsubscribe means the server RETAINED the subscription and dropping
          routing early would silently discard live updates.

        A request without a well-formed ``params.uri`` string is forwarded

    caller knows the declared-env set and this function does not (``env``
    also carries the daemon's ambient values, which must not suppress
    containment; see the containment block below).

    ``env`` is passed verbatim — callers MUST NOT rely on parent process
    env inheritance. The rewriter layer computes the effective env for
    each :class:`PoolKey` and includes it in the hash; spawning with a
    different env than the key claims is a correctness bug that would
    allow cross-tenant leakage.

    Security boundary (accepted risk, documented in
    ``docs/system-specs/modules/security.md`` under MCP Gateway): backends
    spawned here do NOT run inside a Linux mount namespace. The per-session
    sandbox applied in ``AcpClient._spawn()`` protects kiro-cli sessions,
    not gateway-spawned backends. Compensating controls:

    1. ``command`` is taken verbatim from ``KIROCREW_MCP_TARGET_<SERVER>`` env
       vars populated at KiroCrew startup by the rewriter from the user's
       own ``~/.kiro/agents/*.json``. Stubs cannot cause gatewayd to spawn
       an arbitrary binary — only pre-approved MCP servers.
    2. ``GatewayManager._scrub_sensitive_env()`` strips AWS / SSH / GPG /
       git credential env vars before gatewayd inherits them, so spawned
       backends do not inherit credential env (file-level access to
       ``~/.aws`` etc. is a known residual risk — backends that need AWS
       credentials read them from disk via ``ada`` / default credential
       chain, same as today's non-pooled topology).
    3. Backends run as the invoking user's UID, same as kiro-cli —
       the pool does not elevate privileges.

    Tightening this to a full mount namespace for pooled backends is tracked
    as Phase-2 hardening; broader rollout is gated on it.
