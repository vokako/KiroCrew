"""Credential-file change watcher for the MCP gateway.

Polls a credential file and invokes ``on_change`` only when its
**content** changes. The MCP gateway uses this to drain pooled backends
across a credential rotation: backends spawned with the old credential no
longer reach credential-gated services after a rotation, so the gateway
evicts them on change to force respawn with the fresh credential.

The watched path is supplied by the caller (see the ``--credential-watch-path``
flag on ``gatewayd``); this module never hardcodes a path and never
interprets the file's content — the bytes are only hashed for change
detection.

Detection is by **content digest, not bare mtime**. Credential refresh
daemons commonly rewrite the credential file frequently with
*byte-identical* content, bumping mtime without rotating the credential.
An mtime-only watcher fires ``on_change`` on every such no-op rewrite —
observed at 13-26 fires/min — and each fire runs a full
``evict_idle(0.0, include_pinned=True)`` + re-warm, churning pooled
backends out from under live sessions (surfacing to kiro as
"Transport to MCP server is closed"). Hashing the bytes and firing only
on a real content change collapses the storm to the true rotation
cadence (a few times a day).

The digest is recomputed on **every** poll — there is deliberately no
mtime "cheap gate" that skips re-hashing when the timestamp is unchanged.
This module explicitly targets network-mounted home directories, where
timestamp granularity is coarse (NFS/FAT, 1s or worse): a rotation that
rewrites the file in-place within the same mtime tick as the last
observation would leave mtime unchanged, and an mtime-gated watcher would
skip the re-hash and **permanently** miss that rotation (baseline_mtime
never advances, so every later poll short-circuits identically). Hashing
a small credential file each poll is cheap and is already off-loaded to a
worker thread; the storm suppression comes entirely from the digest
comparison rather than from any mtime gate.

Loop shape mirrors :func:`kiro_crew.mcp_gateway.gatewayd._idle_sweeper`:
``wait_for(stop_event.wait(), timeout=interval)`` so the watcher reacts
to graceful shutdown within one tick instead of one full interval, and
``CancelledError`` exits cleanly under ``task.cancel()``.

Behavior contract:

* The very first observation is the **baseline** — it never fires
  ``on_change``. This avoids a spurious "credential changed" the moment
  the watcher starts. The baseline is whatever the first probe sees:
  a present file (its digest) OR an **absent** file (recorded as an absent
  baseline).
* If the first observation is an **absent** file, a later **appearance** is
  a real "no credential -> credential" transition and DOES fire ``on_change``
  — this drains any backend prewarmed during the absent startup window
  (prewarm is scheduled before the watcher's first probe). Only the initial
  absent observation itself is silent.
* After a **present** baseline, the file being **deleted** (present -> absent)
  is a credential *revocation* and DOES fire ``on_change`` — otherwise pooled
  backends keep the revoked credential until deadline/restart. The baseline
  moves to absent, so a later re-appearance fires again. Genuine absence only:
  a transient stat/read ``OSError`` is skipped without firing (a network-mount
  glitch must not spuriously drain).
* An mtime move with **unchanged content** refreshes the mtime gate but
  does NOT fire — this is the no-op-rewrite storm fix.
* Only a **content change** past the baseline fires ``on_change``.
* ``on_change`` may be a sync callable or one returning an awaitable.
  Awaitables are awaited; sync callables run inline.
* Exceptions raised by ``on_change`` are logged and swallowed — one bad
  drain must not kill the watcher.
