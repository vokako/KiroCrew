"""Session-scoped MCP server injection for the shared gateway.

kiro-cli's ACP ``session/new`` accepts an ``mcpServers`` array, and a
session-injected server takes precedence over the same-named entry in the
resolved agent spec: the spec's own copy is never launched. That makes pooling
a protocol-level operation. The broker stubs replace an agent's poolable
servers for the lifetime of one session, and nothing is written to the user's
project, to their ``~/.kiro/agents/``, or through a bind mount — so pooling
works with ``agent.sandbox`` set to ``off`` (the default) and on macOS and
Windows, neither of which can bind-mount.

Only stub entries are injected. A non-poolable server is left entirely to the
agent spec, so its ``env`` — which routinely holds tokens and API keys — never
leaves the file it was declared in. Stub entries carry ``env: {}`` by
construction (``rewriter._build_stub_entry``): the pooled backend is spawned by
gatewayd, not by kiro-cli, so no credential is transmitted here either.

Precedence caveat: same-name override is verified against the shipped binary
(``test_mcp_gateway_session_inject.py`` pins it, including a live check when
kiro-cli is on PATH) but is NOT documented by kiro-cli. The documented
hierarchy covers only the three *file* tiers (agent config > workspace
``mcp.json`` > global ``mcp.json``). If a future release made injection purely
additive, an agent's own copy would launch alongside the stub, which is worse
than not pooling — hence the pinning test.
