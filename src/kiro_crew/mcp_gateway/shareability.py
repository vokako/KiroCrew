"""Decide whether an MCP server LOOKS safe to stub and share, from evidence.

This module answers one question and nothing else: given what we managed to
observe about a server, do we RECOMMEND that the operator stub it (and, on a
separate axis, share its backend)? It never writes config, never spawns a
process, and never reads a file — callers gather evidence and hand it in.

Why a recommendation and never an automatic switch
--------------------------------------------------
The evidence available is genuinely weaker than proof, and the gap is
structural rather than an implementation shortcut:

* The probe connects as ``clientInfo: {"name": "kirocrew-probe"}`` while the
  gateway connects as ``kirocrew-gateway``. A server that negotiates its
  capabilities from ``clientInfo`` can answer the probe differently from the
  pooled backend — the exact hazard ``backend.Backend`` documents when it
  caches the first stub's ``initialize`` result and replays it to later stubs.
* The MCP base protocol models one client per stdio server process. There is
  no spec field that says "I am safe to share", so no amount of reading a
  conformant server's declarations can produce a proof.

So a verdict is an invitation to a human decision. The one thing this module
treats as conclusive is REFUTATION: when the gateway has already watched a
server behave statefully under sharing, that observation outranks every
declaration, and the recommendation is withdrawn.

Evidence strength, strongest first
----------------------------------
``REFUTED``      the gateway observed per-client behaviour while shared.
``DISQUALIFIED`` a declaration we trust rules sharing out up front.
``DECLARED``     the server advertises the caller-identity extension, i.e. it
                 was written for a pooled backend.
``MEASURED``     nothing objected AND the pre-flight actually provoked this
                 server as two different callers without finding a divergence.
``NO_OBJECTION`` nothing disqualifying was found — the weakest useful verdict,
                 and the one whose wording must stay honest about that.
``UNKNOWN``      not enough was observed to say anything.

Why ``MEASURED`` sits below ``DECLARED`` but above ``NO_OBJECTION``
------------------------------------------------------------------
``kirocrew.caller-identity`` is an extension this project invented; the MCP base
protocol has no field for "I can tell my callers apart", so no third-party server
will ever send it. Reserving the top tier for servers that declare it left every
real server resting at ``NO_OBJECTION`` for ever, and made a pre-flight able to
REFUTE a server but never to record anything in its favour — the measurement could
only ever cost the operator a verdict.

``MEASURED`` is that missing rung: the server was provoked as two distinct callers
and answered the same way, which rules OUT a caller-sensitive handshake.

It does NOT recommend sharing, and that limit is the point rather than caution.
The pre-flight compares the HANDSHAKE — capability shapes, ``protocolVersion``,
``serverInfo``, the read-only listings — and never makes a tool call. A server
whose state is process-global (one browser context, one database connection, one
working directory) replays that handshake identically and still cannot serve two
sessions: on a shared backend one caller reads state another caller wrote. A
declaration and a measurement are therefore claims about different properties —
ISOLATION versus DETERMINISM — and only the first is grounds for co-tenancy. The
ledger cannot backstop the difference either: its codes describe frames the
gateway could not route, not state handed to the wrong session.

# one.
#
# First, it is not a leak. The broker already refuses to guess: an unattributable
# request-scoped notification is DROPPED (deny-by-default in
# ``backend._notification_owner``) rather than broadcast, so no co-tenant ever
# receives another tenant's content.
#
# Second, and this is why it informs rather than gates: **it describes a gap in
# OUR broker, not a property of the server.** A proxy that can correlate a frame
# to a caller can route it, and correlation is a feature we can build:
#
# ``logging`` -- ``logging/setLevel`` is process-global, but a proxy can emit at
# the finest level any tenant asked for and filter DOWN per stub, giving each
# tenant the verbosity it requested from one process.
#
# Withholding pooling for it would be charging the operator for work we have
# not done. It is filed as a broker gap instead, and the contract on this table
# is that an entry is DELETED — not relaxed — the moment the broker learns to
# attribute the frames it covers. ``resources.subscribe`` is absent from this
# table under exactly that contract: the broker keeps a ``uri -> {stub_uuid}``
# subscription table (``backend._resource_subscriptions``) and routes each
# ``notifications/resources/updated`` to the stubs subscribed to its URI, so
# subscriptions survive pooling and there is nothing to warn about.
#
# ``*.listChanged`` is deliberately NOT here: those notifications are global
# broadcasts (``backend._GLOBAL_BROADCAST_NOTIFICATIONS``) and are safe to
# fan out to every attached stub.

    #    shapes, ``protocolVersion``, ``serverInfo``, and the read-only listings).
    #    It never makes a tool call. A server whose state is process-global -- one
    #    browser context, one database connection, one working directory -- replays
    #    that handshake identically for two callers and still cannot serve two
    #    sessions, and on a shared backend one caller would receive state another
    #    caller put there.

    #    That is why MEASURED does NOT inherit DECLARED's share flag even though
    #    it sits directly below it: a declaration is a claim about ISOLATION ("I
    #    can tell my callers apart"), while a measurement is a fact about
    #    DETERMINISM ("you answered the same twice"). Conflating the two would let
    #    a bulk action co-tenant a stateful server on evidence that cannot see the

    #    short of a declaration still actionable without being reckless.

    #    A pass that RAN and saw the handshake differ has not earned MEASURED
    #    either. MEASURED's whole content is that something was ruled out, and a
    #    divergence rules nothing out -- so it falls to NO_OBJECTION carrying the
