"""Per-process temp-dir containment for gateway-spawned MCP servers.

Third-party MCP servers write telemetry, caches, and scratch files into
whatever temp directory their process sees. Spawned with an inherited
default, that is the shared system temp dir -- which nothing ever cleans, so
their output accumulates for as long as the host lives. Setting
``TMPDIR``/``TMP``/``TEMP`` at the spawn chokepoint contains every
well-behaved server without touching any server's code. A server that
hardcodes ``/tmp`` ignores the variables and keeps today's behavior: this is
containment, not a sandbox guarantee.

Layout: ``<data home>/run/mcp-tmp/<digest12>-<token8>/`` -- one directory per
spawned PROCESS, not per PoolKey. Two live processes can share a PoolKey (a
connection-private backend spawned beside the shared one), so a sweep keyed
on the digest alone would delete the temp dir out from under the survivor.
The digest prefix keeps the directory attributable to its server config; the
fresh token makes the shutdown sweep single-owner by construction.

PoolKey invariant (same reasoning as the ``KIROCREW_SPAWNED_ENV`` marker in
:func:`kiro_crew.mcp_gateway.backend.spawn_backend`): the injected value is
derived from the key's own digest plus a token generated AFTER pool-identity
resolution, and is never folded into the PoolKey hash -- so it can neither
split nor collapse pooled-backend identity.

Sweep hygiene follows the house rules established by
:mod:`kiro_crew.agents_janitor`: ``os.lstat`` snapshots, symlinks are never
followed (a symlink where a directory is expected is skipped entirely),
deletion happens only for direct children of the managed root, and every
failure is tolerated per entry (fail-open -- hygiene must never take the
daemon down).
