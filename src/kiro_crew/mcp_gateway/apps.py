"""MCP Apps (SEP-1865) disk-spool + result-interception helpers.

The gateway is the actual MCP Apps *host*: when a backend's ``tools/call``
result carries a ``ui://`` resource reference, the gateway fetches that
resource out-of-band (a gateway-originated ``resources/read``), writes the
rendered HTML + render policy to a spool file on disk, and injects an opaque
marker string into the tool result's text content. The chat runner
pattern-matches ``[kirocrew-mcp-app:<id>]`` on the wire, reads the spool file
by its opaque id, and renders the app inline. **The LLM never reads the spool
file** — only the deterministic chat_runner does, keyed by the opaque id.

Security posture:

* The marker carries only an opaque ``uuid4().hex`` — never a filesystem path —
  so a compromised/adversarial tool result cannot smuggle a path-traversal
  reference through the marker.
* Spool files are written ``0600`` inside a ``0700`` directory so co-tenant
  users on a shared host cannot read another session's rendered app payload.
* :func:`sweep_spool` reaps stale files (default 24h) so the spool does not
  grow without bound.

Everything here is invoked only behind the ``KIROCREW_MCP_APPS`` feature flag
that lives in :mod:`kiro_crew.mcp_gateway.backend`; this module has no flag of
its own and is a pure, side-effect-light helper library.

    ONE parser for BOTH directions — the agent's ``tools/list`` (audience

    separate implementations with *opposite* defaults, and the app-side one
    denied on absence while claiming the spec required it. The spec says the
    opposite, so the two are now the same function and cannot drift again.

    How each shape of ``visibility`` is read:

    ==========================  ==============================================
    ``visibility``              Verdict
    ==========================  ==============================================
    absent                      ALLOW — spec default is ``["model", "app"]``
    ``["model", "app"]``        ALLOW for both
    ``["app"]``                 ALLOW app, DENY model
    ``["model"]``               ALLOW model, DENY app
    ``[]``                      DENY both — an explicit empty audience list
    ``"app"`` (bare string)     read as ``["app"]``
    present, uninterpretable    DENY both, flagged ``unreadable``
    ``_meta``/``ui`` = ``null``  ALLOW — a null container is an unset optional
    ``_meta``/``ui`` not a dict  DENY both, flagged ``unreadable``
    ==========================  ==============================================

    Only ABSENCE gets the permissive default, and absence is distinguished from
    malformation at EVERY level, not just the leaf:

    * ``_meta`` missing, or present-and-a-dict with no ``ui`` key, or ``ui``
      present-and-a-dict with no ``visibility`` key → genuine absence → allow.
    * ``_meta`` or ``ui`` explicitly ``null`` → also absence. A JSON ``null`` is
      how serializers spell an unset optional object, and it cannot conceal a
      declaration, so the reason non-dict containers deny does not apply.
    * ``_meta`` or ``ui`` present as some OTHER non-dict → the container that
      would hold the declaration is unreadable, so a visibility may well be in
      there and we cannot see it → deny, flagged ``unreadable``.
    * ``visibility`` present but unparseable → deny, flagged ``unreadable``.

    Absence is tested by key presence rather than by value, so an explicit
    ``"visibility": null`` is a declaration this host cannot read rather than an
    omission — ``.get()`` cannot tell those apart.

    KNOWN DIVERGENCE, pre-existing and deliberately unchanged here: the C#
    reference SDK documents ``null`` and ``[]`` on ``visibility`` ITSELF as
    "visible to both the model and the app by default". This host denies both
    for those two shapes, as it did before this function existed. The SEP text
    grants the default to an OMITTED field, and an explicitly empty audience
    list reads as a deliberate exclusion, so the conservative reading is kept
    rather than widened as a side effect of an unrelated fix. Worth settling
    separately — it is a conformance question, not an oversight.

    Bare strings are coerced rather than lumped in with the unreadable values,
    because the realistic typo for this field is a scalar instead of a
    one-element list; blanket-denying every malformed value would hide a tool
    whose author wrote ``"model"`` meaning to expose it.

    Anything present-but-unreadable denies both audiences: it is an attempt to
    restrict the tool that this host cannot honor, and the errors are not
    symmetric. Over-denying is loud (the name is logged, the tool is simply
    absent) while under-denying silently lets a tool run without readable
    authorization metadata.
