"""Per-process scratch containment for spawned agent (kiro-cli) processes.

Agent sessions have no designated scratch location, so their working residue
-- repository clones, pytest basetemps, probe scripts, screenshots -- lands
in the shared system temp dir, where nothing ties it to the session that made
it and the OS tmp reaper deletes by AGE, killing long-lived in-flight work
while leaving everything younger to accumulate.

Each spawned agent process gets ``<data home>/scratch/<label>-<token8>/`` and
the ``TMPDIR``/``TMP``/``TEMP`` triple plus ``KIROCREW_SCRATCH`` pointing at
it, so ``tempfile`` users, pytest basetemps, shell ``mktemp``, and
prompt-guided work products all land somewhere OWNED. On real disk (the data
home), deliberately not tmpfs: agent residue can be large and must not
occupy RAM.

Reclamation is keyed on PROCESS liveness, never on file age:

* Allocation writes a PROVISIONAL owner pid atomically with the directory
  (and fails the allocation otherwise); the spawner replaces it with the
  child's pid right after spawn. There is deliberately NO per-teardown
  sweep -- agent processes die many ways (clean shutdown, kill escalation,
  crash, gateway restart with survivors), and the positive liveness signal
  below covers every death path by construction.
* The gateway sweeps hourly (first pass an hour after start -- never on the
  boot path). A directory is removed only when its recorded owner's process
  GROUP is dead AND the whole tree has been idle past the grace window; a
  directory with a live owner is never touched (agent processes can outlive
  a gateway restart), an ownerless directory is never deleted, and a garbled
  owner file is left for a human.

Sweep hygiene follows the house rules of :mod:`kiro_crew.agents_janitor`:
``os.lstat`` classification, symlinks never followed, deletion only for
direct children of the managed root, per-entry fail-open.
