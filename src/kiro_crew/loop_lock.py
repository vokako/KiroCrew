"""Loop-bound asyncio lock for module-global declarations.

An ``asyncio.Lock`` binds to the event loop it is first used on; acquiring it
from a *different* loop raises ``RuntimeError`` on Python 3.10+. A module-global
``asyncio.Lock()`` therefore breaks whenever one process runs more than one
event loop over the module's lifetime — pytest-asyncio spinning a fresh loop
per test, or a gateway restart-in-process. A swallowed ``RuntimeError`` from
this surfaces as an intermittent failure far from its cause.

Narrower versions of the fix shape exist (``_get_config_lock`` in
``dashboard/handlers/agents.py``, ``get_lock`` in ``messaging/auto_title.py``,
which every channel's auto-title shares; ``__init__._LazyShutdownEvent``
and the semaphore in
``dashboard/handlers/link_meta.py`` are cousins for other primitives, left
as-is);  :class:`LoopBoundLock` is the shared chokepoint the module-global
locks route through. Declare it at module level exactly like the lock it
replaces::

    _CACHE_LOCK = LoopBoundLock()

    async def handler() -> None:
        async with _CACHE_LOCK:
            ...

Construction is loop-free (safe at import time). Internally the instance keeps
one ``asyncio.Lock`` **per event loop**, in a ``WeakKeyDictionary`` keyed by
the loop, created lazily inside the first acquiring coroutine on that loop:

* ``acquire()``/``release()`` always pair against the *running* loop's lock,
  so a coroutine can never release a lock some other loop's coroutine holds —
  the failure mode a single mutable rebound pointer would have (release on
  loop A silently unlocking loop B's critical section).
* ``locked()`` reads the running loop's lock, matching what ``acquire()`` on
  that loop would contend with — the same object a bare lock's ``locked()``
  describes. Called outside any loop, it reports whether *any* loop's lock is
  held (the conservative answer for sync status probes).
* Weak keys mean a finished loop's lock dies with it: no strong reference
  retains a closed loop and its callback graph.

The guarantee is mutual exclusion *within* each event loop — the same contract
a module-global ``asyncio.Lock`` offered when it worked at all. Two loops
running concurrently (in different threads) each get their own lock and are
NOT mutually excluded; an ``asyncio`` primitive cannot await across loops, so
code needing cross-loop exclusion needs a different design (e.g. a single
owning loop, or a thread lock around non-awaiting sections).

``scripts/check_loop_bound_locks.py`` is the CI gate that keeps new bare
module-global ``asyncio.Lock()``/``Event()``/``Queue()`` declarations from
reintroducing the class.
