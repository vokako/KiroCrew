    PRIVATE, and it must stay private. ``instances/run_marker`` states the rule:
    no "is something listening" helper may be offered, because a caller will
    mistake reachability for identity -- and ``pod``'s own health probe was held
    to that rule for exactly this reason. This function is not exempt by being
    inverted: "nobody is listening" is equally useless as an identity signal, and
    a free port says nothing about who WOULD answer on a busy one.

    So the only caller is :func:`allocate_port`, whose question genuinely is
    binding and nothing else: it is choosing a port to hand a process that has not
    started yet.

    ``SO_REUSEADDR`` is set to MIRROR THE ACTUAL BINDER. A pod's gateway serves
    through ``aiohttp``'s ``TCPSite``, which leaves ``reuse_address`` at its
    asyncio default -- set on POSIX -- so the gateway can bind a port whose only
    occupant is a ``TIME_WAIT`` remnant. A probe without the option is therefore
    STRICTER than the process it is probing for, and the difference is not
    academic: ``pod down`` followed by ``pod up`` leaves the previous gateway's
    accepted connections in ``TIME_WAIT`` on exactly that port, so every quick
    restart would read as a collision and relocate the pod off its derived port
    for nothing. ``instances/port_allocator.py`` documents the same reasoning for
    the SSH forward. ``SO_REUSEADDR`` exempts ``TIME_WAIT`` only, never a live
    ``LISTEN``, so a real collision is still caught.

    That last sentence is POSIX, and deliberately not hedged: on Windows the option
    means something closer to ``SO_REUSEPORT`` and would let this bind succeed
    against a LIVE listener, inverting the answer. It is unguarded because it is
    unreachable -- ``require_backend`` refuses pods on any host without
    ``systemd --user`` or ``launchd``, so nothing calls this there. Anyone reusing
    this probe outside the pod plane has to revisit that.

    Raises :class:`PodError` when the probe cannot be RUN at all -- socket creation
    or option-setting failing, e.g. on file-descriptor exhaustion. That is not the
    same as a port being busy and must not be coerced into ``False``: answering
    "not free" for a probe that never happened would silently relocate a pod on no
    evidence. ``instances/port_allocator.py`` states the same rule for its own probe
    -- "neither answer is true, so it propagates to the caller instead of being
    coerced into one". ``allocate_port`` lets it through and ``pod up`` turns it into
    a refusal, so the operator sees why rather than a traceback.

    this", which is different from "read it and it names no port".

    Separate from :func:`read_env_file` because the trust posture differs. That

    path the CLAIM SCAN found by globbing the pods directory, so the set of files
    read is decided by directory contents rather than by a person -- and this runs in
    the trusted CLI, outside the hooks gate that governs an agent's own reads. A
    symlink planted there would therefore make a privileged process read its target.

    So the open carries ``O_NOFOLLOW`` (a symlink raises ``ELOOP`` and is skipped)
    rather than an ``is_symlink()`` pre-check, which would leave a window between the
    check and the open -- AND ``O_NONBLOCK``, because ``O_NOFOLLOW`` does nothing
    about a FIFO: a named pipe is not a symlink, and a plain ``O_RDONLY`` open of one
    BLOCKS until a writer appears, which would hang every ``pod up`` on the plane
    indefinitely rather than merely reading the wrong bytes. Measured: the blocking
    form never returns, the non-blocking form returns at once.
    ``O_NONBLOCK`` has no effect on reading a regular file, so it costs the normal
    path nothing.

    Nonblocking alone only stops the hang, so the descriptor is then ``fstat``-ed and
    anything that is not a REGULAR file is refused -- a FIFO, a device, a directory.

    and knows when to record the new choice.

    Why this exists: the derivation maps every name into 199 slots
    (``base + (cksum(name) % 199) + 1``), so two worktree names colliding mod 199
    is an ordinary event, not a pathological one, and the derived port can equally
    be held by something that is not a pod at all. Without this, the loser's
    gateway exits "address already in use" and its unit crash-loops -- while
    ``pod url`` keeps printing the shared port, so the operator is pointed at a
    pod that is not the one they just built.

    The answer is recorded by the caller as a ``PORT=`` pin, which
    :func:`derive_port` already prefers over derivation. That is what keeps every
    later reader agreeing without being changed: the pin mechanism predates this
    function and is the reason the fallback needs no new plumbing.

    **An automatic pin is not an operator pin.** A fallback this function chose is
    recorded alongside :data:`AUTO_PORT_KEY`, and a later call will relocate it
    like any other busy port. Without that distinction one transient occupant of
    the derived port -- a ``TIME_WAIT`` remnant, another process for a minute --
    would pin the pod off its derived slot permanently, and every later collision
    on the fallback would hit the "never moved automatically" refusal for a
    decision the operator never made. An operator's OWN ``PORT=`` is still never
    relocated: that would defeat the reason it was pinned.

    THIS FUNCTION ONLY CHOOSES. It writes nothing, so the caller can record the
    choice in the same env write it already performs, inside the lock it already
    holds. Note the probe cannot RESERVE: the port is released before the pod's
    gateway binds it, so see :func:`pod_plane_mutex` for what closes that window
    and what remains open.

    :func:`pod_name_mutex` is per name, which is the right grain for the pin +
    definition + start transaction it guards -- two different pods have no reason
    to serialize their lifecycles. Port allocation is the exception: it is the one
    step where two DIFFERENT names contend, because they contend for the band
    rather than for each other's state.

    Without this, two colliding names ``up``'d concurrently (Dev Fleet's normal
    shape) hold disjoint name locks, both probe the same port free, and both boot
    onto it -- exactly the crash-loop :func:`allocate_port` exists to prevent.
    ``apps/backend.py``'s ``_reserve_free_port`` carries the same lesson one
    subsystem over: "Probing without reserving ... lets two apps be handed the same
    port -- both children then bind it and the loser dies with EADDRINUSE."

    Implemented by BORROWING :func:`pod_name_mutex` under a reserved name rather
    than copying its body: the two differ only in the key, and a second
    hand-maintained copy would drift the moment either grew a feature. The key,
    lock file, reentrancy and lock ordering are therefore identical by
    construction rather than by review.

    **What this does NOT close, stated rather than implied.** The probe releases
    the port before the pod's gateway binds it, and the gateway is a separate
    process, so no lock held here can span the choose->bind gap; a unit is
    ``Type=simple``, so ``start_pod`` returns before the bind. Holding this until a
    health check confirmed the bind WOULD close it, at the cost of serializing
    every pod boot on the plane behind up to 45 health polls of the previous one.
    What closes most of the gap instead is :func:`_walk_band_for_free` consulting
    the pins already recorded on disk, so a concurrent claim is visible before its
    gateway is listening. See that function for the residue that remains.

    Held INSIDE :func:`pod_name_mutex` wherever both are taken, so the acquisition
    order is always name -> plane and cannot deadlock against a second holder.

# Port ownership — WHO answers the pod's port, not merely whether anyone does.
#
# A pod's port is derived, not allocated: `base + (cksum(name) % 199) + 1` maps
# every pod name into 199 slots, and `PORT=` in the per-pod env file can pin any
# port by hand. So two pods colliding on one port is an ordinary event, and the
# live gateway is reachable on the same loopback interface. Whoever binds first
# wins; the loser's gateway exits "address already in use" and the unit
# crash-loops behind it.
#
# A bare `GET /api/health` cannot tell those apart. `{"ok": true}` is the same
# answer from any Kiro Crew gateway on the host, and its identity fields say
# `app=kirocrew` plus a version — true of the squatter as well. Reading a 200 as
# "this pod is up" therefore reports a crash-looping pod as healthy and points
# the operator's browser at somebody else's instance.
#
# `instances/run_marker` states the rule this module was breaking: it
# "deliberately does not offer a bare 'is something listening' helper, so no
# caller can mistake reachability for identity". The pod probe is now held to it
# — the reachability probe is private and every caller goes through `health`.

    execs the gateway in place, so that PID is the process that bound the port,
    and the sidecar is written only AFTER that bind succeeds. A pod that lost
    the bind race therefore has no agreeing record to offer.

    That agreement is only worth anything because the record proves its own
    freshness: :func:`_pod_recorded_pid` answers with a pid ONLY when the

    else, which is the only reason listener attribution was ever load-bearing.

    Listener attribution is CORROBORATION, not a precondition. Its view is
    scoped to the 127.0.0.1 listener the HTTP client reaches, so a pid on the
    port that is not ours is positive proof of a foreign responder and outranks
    any record. But when the host has no usable listener evidence -- no lookup
    tool, a lookup that failed, or a lookup that simply could not see the socket
    -- a provably fresh PID-record/MainPID agreement is sufficient. That is the
    normal supported path on a minimal Linux host, and on any host where the
    caller cannot see another process's sockets (an unprivileged process asking
    ``lsof`` about a gateway started by the user's service manager, which is
    exactly how ``pod api`` runs). Requiring attribution there would withhold
    the credential from every healthy pod forever.

    ``MICROSOFT_APP_TENANT_ID`` / ``FEISHU_APP_ID`` / ``FEISHU_APP_SECRET`` ends
    in ``_TOKEN``, so the generic suffix rule that catches every other channel's
    bot credential passes the Azure Bot secret and the Feishu app secret straight
    through. The loader's complete credential roster is then scrubbed except for
    ``KIRO_API_KEY`` (the pod agent's model credential) and ``KIROCREW_OWNER_ID``
    (dashboard ownership, not a channel or source-provider identity). Provider CLI
    config roots are redirected beneath the pod home so ``gh``, ``glab`` and ``az``

    ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`` survives intact. Config-level channel enables are
    additionally forced off by ``sanitized_seed_config`` (defense-in-depth).

    ``KIROCREW_OS_HOME`` points the pod's own :mod:`kiro_crew.mcp_grant` reads
    (mint, status, disconnect, mcp_discovery's remote probe -- all resolved
    through ``config.paths.kiro_oauth_cache_home``) at a dedicated
    ``<home_dir>/os-home`` tree INSTEAD of the real host home. Without this a
    pod's gateway process stats and unlinks MCP OAuth grant artifacts under the
    REAL ``~/.aws/sso/cache`` -- so a Connections card in the pod reads
    "Connected" from a grant the operator minted on the real machine, and a
    grant minted inside the pod is a real, durable machine-level credential
    that OUTLIVES ``pod down``. This directory is nested INSIDE ``home_dir`` so
    ``cleanup_home``'s teardown reclaims it with everything else. It holds no
    secret by itself -- see ``_seed_pod_os_home`` for what is staged into it,
    and ``acp/client.py`` / ``acp/runtime.py`` for the matching ``HOME`` remap
    on the pod's OWN kiro-cli children, which is what makes kiro-cli's writes

    """Stage ONE SQLite database as a consistent snapshot. True when it landed.

    **Why not a byte copy.** The host store belongs to a LIVE kiro-cli, and a
    WAL-mode database is a SET of files whose contents only agree at an instant.
    Copying ``data.sqlite3`` and then its ``-wal`` with two separate reads takes
    those files at two different times, so a checkpoint landing in between yields a
    main file from after it and a WAL from before -- a torn snapshot whose identity
    rows are missing or malformed, staged into the pod as if it were sign-in state.
    Nothing in a per-file copy loop can close that window, because the window is
    between the copies. SQLite's backup API reads the database through the engine
    under a read transaction, so what it writes is one generation by construction,
    and the sidecars need not be staged at all -- the result already contains every
    committed transaction they held.

    **How the pinned discipline survives an API that takes a path.** ``sqlite3``
    opens by NAME, which is the one thing this module refuses to do on a tree it
    does not own. The bridge is :func:`pinned_fs.fd_real_path`: both ends are opened
    as descriptors FIRST (source ``O_NOFOLLOW`` relative to the already-validated
    ``src_dir_fd``; destination ``O_CREAT | O_EXCL`` relative to ``dst_dir_fd``, so
    anything sitting at that name is a plant and creation refuses it rather than
    following it), and the path handed to ``sqlite3`` is then the KERNEL's own name
    for the inode already held open. That name has no symlink component left to
    swap, which is the property the descriptor discipline exists to get. Both opens
    fail closed: no descriptor, or no readable real path, and the store is refused.

    The mode is set with ``fchmod`` on the created descriptor -- before any bytes
    are written and on the fd rather than the name -- so the file is never briefly
    group-readable and the mode cannot land on some other inode.

    **Temp-then-rename, both inside the pinned destination directory.** A backup is
    not atomic, so an interrupted one leaves a short database that looks staged. The
    snapshot is built at a temp name and ``os.rename``d onto the real one with BOTH
    ``src_dir_fd`` and ``dst_dir_fd`` pinned to the same validated directory, so the
    name a reader can see either does not exist or is a complete snapshot, and the
    rename cannot be redirected out of the directory it was checked in. A leftover
    temp from a killed boot is cleaned up on the next attempt: it is created
    ``O_EXCL``, so a stale one is unlinked through the pinned fd first.

    Read-only on the source (``mode=ro``), so staging a pod can never write to the
    operator's live store.

    This is what lets a sign-in performed ONCE on the operator's real machine be
    reused by every pod, while a pod's own MCP OAuth grants stay confined to
    ``os_home`` -- see ``build_pod_env``'s
    ``KIROCREW_OS_HOME`` docstring for the split this closes. The sign-in material
    staged is the AGENT RUNTIME's own identity store
    (``_runtime_auth_store_mappings``, derived from ``identity_stores``);
    the ``.aws/sso/cache`` tree is CREATED empty and never populated from the host,
    so the pod's grant corridor holds only what the pod itself mints.

    **Every component is created and opened through a PINNED no-follow
    descriptor, never by name.** This function copies a HOST credential into a
    tree under the pod root, and it runs again on every boot -- so a name-based
    ``mkdir(parents=True)`` plus a by-name write would follow a symlink planted
    at ``os-home`` (or at any component beneath it) and deposit the operator's
    SSO token wherever that link pointed, including an agent-readable workspace.
    ``pinned_fs.create_and_open_dir_pinned`` refuses a link at the component it
    creates and pins the parent chain first, and ``pinned_fs.copy_file_pinned``
    validates the descriptor it copies rather than the name, so the inode
    written is the inode checked. This is the same discipline
    ``seed_home_from_scenario`` in this module already applies to a seeded home.

    Create-only and per-file: ``skip_existing`` leaves an existing destination
    untouched (a pod that already signed in, or already refreshed its own token,
    is not clobbered), and a missing or unreadable source token is skipped
    rather than aborting the whole pod boot -- a signed-out host still boots a
    pod that can prompt for sign-in inside it, which is strictly better than
    refusing to boot at all. The staged token is forced to ``0o600`` and every
    directory to ``0o700``, so a token never lands world-readable even if the
    source file's own mode is looser.

    **Raises PodError when the TREE ITSELF cannot be built through pinned
    no-follow descriptors, and that refusal must abort the boot** (``boot`` does
    exactly this). The two phases are deliberately NOT equally forgiving:

    * Building the tree is MANDATORY. This directory becomes the pod child's
      ``HOME`` (``build_pod_env`` exports it as ``KIROCREW_OS_HOME``,
      ``acp.client._apply_pod_home_remap`` assigns it), so if a component is a
      planted symlink the refusal here is the ONLY thing standing between the
      pod's kiro-cli and the real host tree the link points at. An earlier
      revision swallowed this refusal and booted anyway: nothing was written
      through the link by THIS function, but the child then received the refused
      path as its ``HOME`` and wrote its own MCP OAuth grants through the link --
      turning the pod back into the machine-level grant writer this whole
      mechanism exists to prevent. Skipping the seed is safe; booting on an
      unverified ``HOME`` is not, so the two outcomes must not share a branch.
    * Copying the tokens is BEST-EFFORT, unchanged. An unreadable host cache
      (signed out, permission error, stalled mount) and an individual token that
      cannot be copied both leave the pod booting signed-out.

    Every component is chmodded to ``0o700`` rather than only the leaf, so no
    level of the path this credential lands under is group- or world-writable --
    that is the narrowest replacement window the pinned primitives allow. The
    residual is a genuine TOCTOU: a same-UID process can still swap a component
    between this function returning and the child's ``exec``. Per the recorded
    threat model a pod is operational isolation, not protection from arbitrary
    same-UID processes, so that window is documented rather than claimed closed;
    closing it would require handing the child a descriptor instead of a path,
    which the kiro-cli interface does not accept.

#   service        — installs/removes the machine-wide systemd unit
#   gateway        — would race a second gateway against the pod's own unit
#   pod            — pod management from inside a pod (a nested `pod down` would
#                    tear down its own supervisor)
#   cloud          — provisions resources in the user's AWS account
#   browse         — writes browser auth state outside KIROCREW_HOME
#   manifest       — emits a Slack app manifest tied to the real identity
#   run            — `task_reporter.save_progress` writes `TASK_PROGRESS.md`
#                    "next to the spec file" (`Path(run.spec_path).parent`), so
#                    `run /host/TASK.md` writes `/host/TASK_PROGRESS.md`. An
#                    IMPLICIT write outside the pod, derived from a path the user
#                    supplied as an input rather than a destination.
#   snapshot       — its destination is CONFIGURABLE (`snapshot_dir`, or a
#                    positional dir) and `--keep N` DELETES older archives beyond
#                    N. `sanitized_seed_config` only forces tunnel/telegram/wecom
#                    off, so a pod seeded from the live config inherits the user's
#                    real backup directory — `snapshot --keep 1` from a pod would
#                    prune live backups. Destructive and cross-plane.
#   doctor         — NOT read-only: `cli_doctor.py:126` does
#                    `atomic_write(agent_path, ...)` where `agent_path` is
#                    `KIRO_AGENTS_DIR / AGENT_FILENAME` (line 405), i.e. under the
#                    real HOME. It auto-adds missing MCP servers, so a pod
#                    `doctor` rewrites the LIVE agent configuration.
#   tui, chat      — `cli_chat._tui` resolves its port as
#                    `getattr(args, "port", None) or cfg…get("port", 5476)` — the
#                    CONFIG dashboard port, falling back to literal 5476, never
#                    `KIROCREW_PORT`. A pod's config names no dashboard port, so it
#                    lands on the LIVE gateway. `chat` is excluded too because
#                    `chat --tui` branches straight into `_tui` (cli.py:1818), so
#                    excluding only `tui` left the same hole open. Every OTHER
#                    client verb (`status`, `logout`, and the credential verb) goes
#                    through `port_resolution.resolve_client_port`, which DOES honour
#                    `KIROCREW_PORT` — so this hazard is confined to `_tui`.
#   logs           — `cli_server._logs_cmd` runs `journalctl -u <SERVICE_NAME>`,
#                    the HOST service unit, so inside a pod it would show the LIVE
#                    gateway's journal while appearing to show the pod's. Wrong
#                    answer rather than damage, but a confidently wrong one.
#                    `kirocrew pod logs NAME` reads the pod's own unit.
#   mcp-*          — stdio server entrypoints, not user-facing commands
#
# `agent` and `workspace` ARE listed: both dispatchers were checked and operate
# only on `config_dir()` state (the config.json agents/workspaces maps), never on
# `~/.kiro/agents`. `workspace` is safe specifically because it asserts every
# source and destination `is_relative_to(config_dir())`; without that guard it
# would belong with `snapshot`. `restore` is listed because although its SOURCE
# archive path is arbitrary, that is a read — everything it writes lands in
# `config_dir()`.
#
# The inclusion test, stated once so it does not have to be rediscovered. A verb
# qualifies only if BOTH hold:
#   (a) every path it writes IMPLICITLY — anywhere the user did not name as a
#       destination — is inside `config_dir()`; and
#   (b) it deletes nothing outside `config_dir()`.
# An explicitly-named output destination is fine (`memory export -o FILE` writes
# where the user pointed it, no differently from shell redirection). What fails is
# an implicit write derived from an INPUT path (`run` → `TASK_PROGRESS.md` beside
# the spec), a host registry (`app`), a host service (`service`, `stop`,
# `restart`), a deletion driven by config (`snapshot --keep`), or a host-scoped
# read that merely LOOKS pod-scoped (`logs`).

    whose child cannot start never reaches health 200 and systemd does not
    restart into the same failure every 5s.

    **Why this exists.** The pod remaps the child's ``HOME`` so its OAuth grants
    die with the pod, and that remap broke every ACP spawn in a pod for a whole
    revision while ``/health`` answered 200 the entire time: the failure surfaced
    only as ``agent_unreachable`` on each provider's Connect/Test, which reads as
    a Connections bug rather than a boot failure. A pod that cannot run an agent
    turn is not a working pod, so it must fail at ``pod up``, loudly, with the
    reason recorded where ``kirocrew pod status`` shows it.

    **The probe is the real spawn path, not an approximation.** It resolves the
    executable the same way and passes it through
    ``acp.client.apply_pod_bundle_spawn``, so the bundle-binary substitution the
    pod child depends on is what gets exercised. Anything cheaper (a bare
    ``--version``) short-circuits before the harness bootstraps and would have
    reported the broken revision as healthy -- that is precisely the mistake an
    earlier round's component test made.

    * Still running when the bound expires -- a healthy ``acp`` child waiting on

    * Exited naming its own login gate -- started fine, has no credential.
      Accepted with a warning, because seeding is best-effort.
    * Exited any other way -- could not bootstrap. REFUSED, with the captured
      stderr tail as the recorded reason.

    A missing kiro-cli is NOT a refusal: it is a separate prerequisite Kiro Crew
    does not bundle, it has its own message elsewhere, and failing the boot for it

    **This wrapper is the class closure for "a refusal that escapes the boot path
    with a non-terminal exit".** Three rounds fixed instances of it one at a time:
    round 7 unified the explicit ``return`` sites through :func:`_refuse`, round 8
    added an AST guard over those returns -- and round 9's finding walked straight
    past both, because a ``raise PodError`` is neither a bare return nor visible to
    a scan over returns. It escaped to the CLI's generic handler, which exits 1, a
    code NOT in :data:`TERMINAL_BOOT_EXIT_CODES`, so systemd retried it and
    launchd's KeepAlive restarted it every ``ThrottleInterval``: the exact
    restart-loop the terminal-exit work exists to prevent, reached by the one shape
    the guard did not cover.

    Enumerating raises would not have closed it either. ``PodError`` is raised from
    roughly forty sites under ``pod/``, many of them transitively reachable from
    here (``validate_name``, ``read_env_file``, ``write_pod_config``,
    ``seed_home_from_scenario``, ``_ensure_pod_dir``, the whole ``pinned_fs``
    refusal surface), and any future one would join them silently. So the
    conversion is structural instead: the body cannot raise ``PodError`` past this
    frame, and a refusal added tomorrow is recorded and given a terminal code
    without anyone remembering to route it.

    ``execve`` replaces the process on the success path, so nothing after the body
    can run and the wrapper costs the happy path nothing.

    **Name validation happens BEFORE the guard, deliberately.** The wrapper records
    every refusal it catches, and ``_record_refusal`` derives its path from *name* --
    so catching a NAME-validation failure turned the refusal machinery into a
    host-write primitive: ``pod _run /tmp/important`` would have written
    ``/tmp/important.refused`` outside the pod plane. There is no legitimate pod to
    record against when the name itself is rejected, so that failure exits with the
    honest error and writes nothing. The guard therefore only ever sees a validated
    name, which is also what lets ``_record_refusal`` treat a path-shaped name as
    unreachable rather than merely unlikely.
