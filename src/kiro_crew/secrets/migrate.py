"""One-time importer that moves plaintext Jira ``.env`` tokens into the vault.

Kiro Crew stored the Jira API token as a plaintext ``KEY=VALUE`` line in the
data home's ``.env`` (``~/.kiro/crew/.env``). The encrypted vault
(:class:`~kiro_crew.secrets.SecretVault`) supersedes that store, and the
``secret://`` resolver / vault-aware Jira consumer reads the secret without
ever exposing the plaintext to the agent.

This module bridges the two for the ONLY vault-aware credential surface in this
change: the global ``JIRA_API_TOKEN`` and the per-host ``JIRA_TOKEN_<HEX>``
tokens that ``_get_jira_auth`` resolves vault-first. For each such token still
held in plaintext it writes the value into the vault under the same key name
and rewrites the ``.env`` line to ``KEY=secret://KEY``. Other credential keys
(Slack, Discord, kiro-cli, …) are deliberately NOT migrated — their consumers
still read the literal ``.env`` value, so rewriting them to a ``secret://``
reference would break auth. The source file is never deleted — the caller is
told exactly what migrated and how to remove the leftover plaintext.

The importer is idempotent and order-correct: a line already holding a
``secret://`` reference (or a later empty line) for a key WINS over any earlier
plaintext line for that key, so re-running after an apply never regresses an
already-migrated key. A key already present in the vault is treated as
authoritative — its plaintext ``.env`` value is NEVER written over the stored
secret (only the ``.env`` line is rewritten to the ``secret://`` reference) —
but ONLY when its stored entry actually decrypts; a listed-but-undecryptable
entry (missing/mismatched vault key) aborts the migration so the still-usable
plaintext is not rewritten away. A key whose value is overridden by a nonempty
process-environment entry is skipped (the environment is runtime-authoritative,
so migrating the stale file value would shadow the live override). The ``.env``
read-snapshot → compare → rewrite runs as one critical section under an
exclusive OS advisory lock (``platform_compat.try_acquire_lock`` on a sidecar
``.env.lock``; POSIX flock / Windows msvcrt), with two complementary guards: the
lock serializes against any OTHER PROCESS that holds the same lock (a second
importer, or any writer that adopts it — today also the WeChat/Weixin QR
sign-in handler in ``dashboard.handlers.weixin_qr``), and — under that lock — a
compare-and-swap re-read aborts the rewrite (no write) if the bytes changed since
the snapshot, catching any residual in-process writer that might not take the
lock.  If the lock cannot be taken, the migration aborts cleanly and a re-run
reconciles (idempotent, secret://-line-wins).
