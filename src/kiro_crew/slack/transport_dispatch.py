"""Full new-path dispatch: SlackTransport → TurnDriver → SlackRenderer.

When ``messaging.use_transport`` is True, events.py routes inbound Slack
messages here instead of directly calling ``handle_message``. This exercises
the entire messaging abstraction end-to-end:

  SlackTransport.receive() → authorize → normalize
  → dispatch callback:
      session acquire → context build → TurnDriver.run(provider, renderer)
      → SlackRenderer renders to Slack API
      → conversation log + cleanup

The old ``handle_message`` is completely bypassed. Dashboard link paths are
unaffected (they don't go through events.py Slack dispatch).

        # ── Rescue partial progress ──
        # A transient backend fault (the "died before streaming started" class,
        # a dropped stream) leaves the user row on disk and everything the model
        # already produced in memory only. Nothing persisted it, so each retry
        # re-read a transcript that ended at the question and started over: a
        # 28-minute outage on 2026-09-02 burned five identical attempts that each
        # re-derived the same ticket ids before dying again.
        #
        # Persisting the partial reply makes the next attempt resume — it reads
        # what was already established instead of rediscovering it. Guarded so
        # this can never make the failure worse:
        #   * ``_stamped_turn`` — the reply already landed via the OPTIONS stamp,
        #     so writing again would duplicate the turn.
        #   * ``renderer.turn_finalized`` — the turn already ENDED normally. A
        #     fault raised after the stream finished (a footer post that fails,
        #     say) unwinds through this same branch, and stamping that complete
        #     reply as cut off would tell the next turn to resume finished work.
        #     Safe to read here: ``close()`` also sets the flag, but from the
        #     ``finally`` below, which runs after this decision is made.
        #   * ``_logged_user_turn`` — the rescue runs ONLY when the user row is
        #     confirmed on disk. When the receipt append raised, whether the row
        #     landed is unknowable from here: ``ConversationLog.append`` writes
        #     the row and only then invalidates caches and calls
        #     ``_maybe_rotate``, whose own guard covers just the ``stat`` — so a
        #     rotation fault on an oversized transcript raises with the row
        #     already durable, while a lock timeout raises with nothing written.
        #     Writing both rows there would duplicate the question; writing the
        #     assistant row alone would orphan the answer. Neither is honest, so
        #     the rescue no-ops and the retry starts from the question, exactly
        #     as it did before this change. Same rule the delivery ledger applies
        #     to an unacknowledged send: when an outcome is unconfirmable, record
        #     nothing.
        #   * ``_is_slack_restricted`` — incognito/temporary sessions persist
        #     nothing, same as both success-path writes.
        #   * off-loop ``to_thread``, because ``append`` takes a cross-process
        #     flock and ON the loop it single-shots and drops the row.
        #   * its own try/except: a disk failure here must not replace the real
        #     exception in the log with a bookkeeping one.
        # Persist only what Slack CONFIRMED it showed. ``SlackRenderer`` batches on
        # an edit throttle, so the text the model has produced runs routinely ahead
        # of the text the user has seen; a rescue that persisted the former would
        # record unseen output as established fact, and the retry would build on
        # something that was never on screen. ``delivered_text`` is the renderer's
        # delivery ledger — advanced only where Slack acknowledged the append — so
        # it is the honest source here.
        #
        # This is the only rescue in the codebase, on purpose — and the reason is
        # confirmable delivery, not an absence of mid-turn sending. Renderers on
        # the shared ``messaging/dispatch.drive_turn`` path DO emit during a turn
