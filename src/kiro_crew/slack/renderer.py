"""Slack ``Renderer`` for the channel-neutral ``TurnDriver``.

Maps the abstract ``OutputEvent`` stream emitted by
``kiro_crew.messaging.TurnDriver`` onto Slack's streaming + Block Kit surface
via ``SlackClientOps``. This is the Slack-specific half of the neutral
messaging layer.

Import direction: ``slack`` -> ``messaging`` (never the reverse), so this lives
in the ``slack`` package and consumes the neutral ``messaging`` contracts.

``prompt_choice`` (the first-class approval event) renders as Block Kit
approve/deny buttons. The interactive decision is awaited via
:class:`SlackApprovalDecider`, whose future is resolved by the Slack
interaction handler when the user clicks a button.

Two channel-neutral halves own work this module deliberately does not:

* **Length splitting** belongs to
  :func:`kiro_crew.messaging.split.split_markdown_safe`, the shared fence-safe
  splitter, so this renderer owns no fence grammar. ``slack/format.py``'s
  ``split_message`` counts backticks and cuts anywhere a newline sits, which
  inverts its own open/closed state on a fence whose content contains one; it
  stays for the native handler's call sites. The splitter's streaming contract is
  consumed as written: every chunk but the last is sealed, the final one is left
  open, and the one documented over-``limit`` case (a whole line placed with its
  fence scaffolding) is bounded again against the limit Slack's own update path
  truncates at.
* **Outbound local-image extraction** belongs to
  :mod:`kiro_crew.messaging.outbound_files`, with Slack's per-file ceiling, count
  cap and ``files_upload_v2`` call in :mod:`kiro_crew.slack.files`. Extraction
  runs once, at the SEMANTIC seal (``on_done``), never on a length cut, so a
  reference is always seen whole and in its original fence context. Slack's
  stream is append-only, so markup is withheld from live frames rather than
  hidden and later edited away, and the withheld tail lands at the seal.

          of ``_accumulated``, never a superset.

        Slack is the only renderer this exists on because Slack is the only
        renderer that can say afterwards WHICH bytes the user retained. Others on
