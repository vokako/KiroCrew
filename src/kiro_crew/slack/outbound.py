"""The lifecycle of a posted Slack OPTIONS control.

Rendering text for Slack is NOT this module's job. ``slack.format`` owns that —
``render_for_slack`` for bodies and ``build_options_blocks`` for the control,
which redacts every choice through ``redact_for_display`` so a key split by ANSI,
emphasis, backticks or link markup is caught in the form Slack actually shows.
This module deliberately holds no second copy of that pipeline: two copies
drift apart, and the same credential-exposure bug then has to be fixed in
both.

What is left here is the part ``slack.format`` has no opinion about: whether a
posted control is still answering the question the conversation is on.

That is decided when a click ARRIVES, not on the turn before. A control goes out
carrying a token -- the conversation that asked, and how far it had got (see
:func:`encode_options_token`) -- and the click is judged by comparing that token
against the transcript on disk. Both halves outlive the process, so a gateway
restart cannot turn a superseded button back into a live one; nothing here is
remembered between clicks.

``expire_options`` still strikes a spent control through, but only as
presentation: a click on an un-struck control is refused on its own terms, so the
edit failing leaves the thread untidy rather than unsafe. ``_ANSWERED`` is the one
piece of memory that remains, and it is not about staleness at all -- it stops a
double-click from dispatching the same answer twice, a race that is entirely
within one process by construction.
