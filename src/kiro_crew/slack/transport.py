"""Slack as a concrete :class:`MessagingTransport`.

This wraps the existing ``SlackClientOps`` surface in the channel-neutral
transport contract. Nothing in the live gateway path constructs it: the Slack
path routes through ``slack.transport_dispatch`` (TurnDriver + SlackRenderer)
and only ``SlackTransport.channel_type`` is read, by ``handlers_system``.

Direction of dependency is ``slack -> messaging`` (allowed): the neutral
``messaging`` package never imports Slack.

Security note: :meth:`SlackTransport.authorize` is **deny-by-default** and
owner-only. An unconfigured transport (empty ``allowed_users``) authorizes
nobody. Bot-authored events are dropped unless their ``bot_id`` positively
matches the ``trusted_bot_ids`` allow-list (empty by default, so an
unconfigured transport drops every bot), mirroring the Socket Mode drop site
in ``slack/events.py`` so the two inbound paths agree.
