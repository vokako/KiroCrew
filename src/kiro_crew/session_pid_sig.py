"""Signed publication and verification of the ``session_pid_<pid>.txt`` contract.

The gateway maps its direct child pid to a session key by writing
``config_dir()/session_pid_<pid>.txt`` on session claim. Sandboxed identity
resolvers look the file up directly via the launcher-exported
``KIROCREW_HOST_PID`` (PID-namespace sandboxing strips ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY``
from the sandboxed env, and renumbers pids so a ``/proc`` walk cannot match).

The bare ``.txt`` file is NOT a trust root: it lives in ``config_dir()`` which
is same-uid agent-writable, so an agent (or subagent) could forge a mapping for
its own host pid pointing at another slot's key and cross the session
authorization boundary. This module makes the mapping authenticated:

* :func:`publish_session_pid` — the ONLY legitimate write path (gateway-side).
  Writes the ``.txt`` file plus a ``session_pid_<pid>.sig`` sidecar containing
  an HMAC-SHA256 over ``"<pid>:<body>"`` — *body* being the full published
  ``.txt`` content: the session key alone (legacy), or the session key plus a
  second line carrying the process START TOKEN (PID-recycle guard; see
  below). The MAC is keyed with a subkey **derived
  from** the SEL trust root (``sel_hmac.key`` — the same key that makes the
  security event log tamper-evident, and whose reads are deny-listed for agent
  shells in ``security.py``) via a domain-separation label. The raw root key
  never signs a sidecar directly, so this protocol and the SEL audit chain
  never share a signing key.
* :func:`verify_session_pid` — used by STRICT identity resolvers
  (state-mutating MCP tools). Returns the session key only when the sidecar
  verifies; missing/invalid signature fails closed to ``""``.

PID-recycle guard: binding only the pid NUMBER would let a mapping keep
verifying once the OS recycled the pid, answering for the NEW process with
the previous owner's session key until the next restart's orphan sweep.
Publication records the process
incarnation (``platform_compat.get_process_start_id`` — the same identity
``session_pid.py`` writes into its ``<gw>:<pid>:<start_token>`` sweep
records) and BOTH readers refuse on a proven mismatch, while an absent
(legacy file) or unreadable (Windows) token stays "unknown", never a
mismatch. Same-uid only: this is a robustness/misattribution guard, not a
privilege boundary — the recycled process already runs as the same user.

Why forgery dies: an agent cannot read ``sel_hmac.key`` (deny-listed), so it
cannot produce a valid sidecar for a forged ``.txt``. Replaying another pid's
``.txt``/``.sig`` pair under its own pid fails because the pid is bound into
the MAC. Residual risk (an agent evading the deny-list to read the key) is
identical to the existing SEL tamper-evidence threat model.

Lenient resolvers (read-only callers where misattribution is harmless) keep
reading the ``.txt`` without a signature check, but through
:func:`read_session_pid_txt` (same hardened no-follow read path) — the
sidecar is additive, no format break.

Threat model — what the sidecar does and does NOT defend against:

* IN SCOPE (blocked): file forgery (agent writes a bare ``.txt`` mapping its
  own pid to another slot's key — no valid sidecar can be produced without
  the deny-listed root key), cross-pid replay (copying another pid's
  ``.txt``/``.sig`` pair — the pid is bound into the MAC), tampering
  (redirecting a signed ``.txt`` — the MAC does not match the new bytes), and
  symlink planting at the predictable paths on BOTH sides: publication uses
  ``atomic_write``/``os.replace`` (swaps a symlink out rather than following
  it), and verification opens with ``O_NOFOLLOW`` + regular-file check so a
  planted symlink can never make the trusted MCP process read a sensitive
  target (see :func:`_read_regular_nofollow`).
* OUT OF SCOPE (unchanged from the env-only baseline): a same-uid agent
  deliberately launching its OWN process with attacker-chosen env
  (``KIROCREW_HOST_PID=<victim pid>``) to reuse a legitimate sidecar. This
  is not a capability the sidecar adds — the identical attack defeats
  env-only resolution (``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY=<victim key>`` with the key
  read from the same world-readable ``.txt`` files), and a shell-capable
  same-uid agent can bypass client-side resolution entirely by minting a
  local API token. The same equivalence covers STALE-pair replay: an agent
  retaining a valid ``.txt``/``.sig`` pair and restoring it after the pid
  is rekeyed to another session needs same-uid write access to
  ``~/.kiro/crew`` — the exact capability that already lets it read the
  victim key from the pre-existing ``.txt`` and present it via env, so a
  generation/nonce scheme here would not remove any attacker capability
  (the publisher overwrites the pair atomically on every rekey, so stale
  pairs never persist absent that deliberate same-uid interference). No
  client-side resolver can prove process ownership; within gateway-managed
  process trees (the strict resolver's actual threat model)
  ``KIROCREW_HOST_PID`` is launcher-declared, not attacker-chosen.
  Authenticating the calling process itself (e.g. SO_PEERCRED over a
  gateway-controlled unix socket) is the stronger, orthogonal follow-up
  tracked separately.
