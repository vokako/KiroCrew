"""The one import surface between application code and an agent backend.

Provider-neutral turn usage and stop-reason vocabulary live here first. The
boundary is enforced by ``scripts/check_agent_sdk_boundary.py`` and
``test/test_agent_sdk_boundary.py``, so application code cannot introduce new
direct dependencies on the backend packages while the rest of the SDK is built.

Machine-local backend readiness lives in :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backend_install`.
Promptless structured command batches live in
:mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.native_commands`; their ACP process lifecycle and
exception translation stay in the driver, and only plain data crosses upward.

                                                  session handles, worker pool

If the gate goes red you introduced a boundary violation: fix the import
direction rather than relaxing the rule, and never add or raise a line in
``.github/agent-sdk-boundary-baseline.txt`` to make it green.

``docs/request-for-change/rfc-crew-agent-sdk-boundary.md``.
