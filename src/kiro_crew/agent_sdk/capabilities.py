"""What a live session's backend can do — asked instead of which backend it is.

Application code used to answer six questions by naming a harness: is this the
claude backend? Each of those branches actually depended on a PROPERTY of the
harness, and naming the harness instead of the property has one failure mode,
always in the same direction. A fifth backend arrives, nobody edits the branch,
and it silently takes whichever arm "not claude" happens to select — an arm it
never demonstrated it can serve. ``docs/system-specs/modules/harness-parity.md``
calls this H6; RFC PR 3 is where it stops being possible outside the boundary.

So this module carries one frozen record per session, with one field per question
a consumer OUTSIDE ``kiro_crew.agent_sdk`` actually asks, and consumers read the
field. The identity of the backend is still in :attr:`SessionCapabilities.backend`
because a log line and an error message need to name it — but nothing branches on
it, and ``test_agent_sdk_capabilities`` pins that.

Every field is a TRANSLATION of a table that already existed in
:mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backends`, not a new judgement. That is deliberate and
it is the whole reason this can land as a refactor: each field reproduces, for
every backend id including ``codex`` and including an unknown id, exactly the
answer the branch it replaces already computed. The disposition table in
``backends``'s docstring records which set each field translates.

Fail-closed on an unknown id
----------------------------
:func:`capabilities_for` never raises and never guesses. An id this build does not
know resolves to :data:`UNKNOWN_BACKEND_CAPABILITIES` — every boolean False and
both string axes on their default — which is the same answer the old
``== ACP_BACKEND_CLAUDE`` comparisons gave an unrecognized value. False here means
"has not demonstrated the capability", so the arm a stranger takes is the
conservative one rather than the one the previous member happened to leave behind.

Why a record and not a bag of module functions
----------------------------------------------
:func:`capabilities_of` resolves the record from a PROVIDER, and the isinstance
check it performs is load-bearing rather than defensive noise. The predicates this
replaces were ``isinstance(provider, AcpProvider) and provider.is_claude_backend``,
so a shape that was not a provider answered False. A bare
``getattr(provider, "capabilities", None)`` would not preserve that:
``MagicMock(spec=AcpProvider).capabilities`` is a truthy Mock whose every
attribute is also truthy, so a spec'd test double would start reading as a member
of every capability at once. Requiring a real :class:`SessionCapabilities`
instance keeps an unknown shape on the fail-closed default, which is what the
isinstance gate bought.
