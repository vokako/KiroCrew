"""Is the harness for each agent backend actually installed on THIS machine?

``acp_backends`` answers *capability* (can this build drive the harness) and
``agent_backend_governance`` answers *permission* (may this deployment select
it). Both are build- and policy-time facts, so a dashboard that gates the
backend switch on them alone offers an option that resolves nothing at spawn
time: the operator picks Claude Code, the session dies in ``session/new``, and
nothing on the page ever said which component was absent. This module answers
the third, machine-local question, and is the only one whose answer can change
without a config write or a new build.

**The resolving itself is the driver's, not this module's.** Everything that has
to reach the harness -- the binary resolves, the read of the spawn's own
process-lifetime cache, the remedy's package name -- lives in
:mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.drivers.acp` and comes back as plain data. What stays
here is the contract: which states exist, which component a remedy may name, and
how long a verdict is reused. That split is the boundary this package exists to
draw, so this module imports nothing from ``kiro_crew.acp`` at any scope.

Three states, and the third is not padding. ``UNKNOWN`` means the CHECK failed
-- a resolver raised, or no probe exists for the id -- and it must never be
reported as ``MISSING``: that tells someone to install what they may already
have, and the remedy is a global npm install.
