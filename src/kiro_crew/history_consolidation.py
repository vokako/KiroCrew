        Unlike history/semantic/lesson extraction — which correctly runs on the
        incremental unconsolidated tail — skill detection judges the last
        ``_SKILL_DETECTION_WINDOW`` messages of the WHOLE session, decoupled
        from the consolidation offset. A reusable procedure usually spans a
        session rather than the slice since the last consolidation, so a
        tail-only view systematically misses skills in any session consolidated
        more than once. The skill need only be demonstrated by PART of the
        window; the pass does not have to cover the whole session.

        Runs as its own LLM call so the consolidation prompt stays tail-scoped
        (widening THAT prompt would re-summarize already-consolidated messages
        into duplicate history/semantic entries). A per-session
        (rotation_generation, count) guard skips re-running when nothing new has
        been appended since the last pass, yet still forces a fresh pass after a
        transcript rotation (which swaps the window's content); genuine repeats
        are still caught by the dedupe verdict in ``_process_auto_skills``.

        The prompt gates on RECURRENCE, not effort. A session can be long,
        difficult, and rich in tool calls while still being one-off — a single
        bug's fix, a one-time audit of one component, a probe answering a
        question that is now answered — and the tool-call floor
        (``auto_min_tool_calls``) cannot tell those apart from a repeatable
        method. So the prompt makes the model name the future session and the
        DIFFERENT target that would reuse the procedure, and return null when
        the only honest answer reuses this session's own artifact. It also
        prefers null under uncertainty: an unreusable candidate is not free,
        because it spends the human's review attention on every later proposal.

        Raises :class:`_ConsolidationNotDispatched` when the prompt never reached
        the provider at all — no session manager, or the background session could
        not be acquired because kiro-cli is missing, not logged in, or failing to

        because the two cost different things: a spent turn costs money and must
        consume the caller's retry budget, while a prompt that was never sent costs
        nothing and must not, or a broken host would abandon spans it never read.
        An exception (rather than a flag beside the result) is used so a caller
        cannot silently drop the distinction.

        Once ``stream_and_collect_json`` is entered the prompt counts as sent: a
        failure inside it may still have been billed, so it returns ``None`` and is
        charged rather than risk an unbounded retry loop over real spend.
