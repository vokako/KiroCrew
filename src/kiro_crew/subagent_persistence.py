# ── per-agent write serialization ────────────────────────────────────

#: ``update_state`` is a read / merge / rewrite, and its two halves are split by
#: a blocking ``_atomic_write`` (fsync + rename). Two writers on one ``agent_id``
#: therefore interleave: the second one's read predates the first one's write, so
#: its rewrite restores a stale WHOLE-FILE snapshot and silently rolls back every
#: field the first writer had just landed. Losing the other writer's fields is
#: the visible half; rolling back fields NEITHER writer touched is the damaging
#: half.
#:
#: The overlap is structural, not hypothetical. A run writes state from the event
#: loop (PID, session id, provider, retention ``keep``) AND from the thread pool
#: (model provenance, CC-path model refinement, per-turn diagnostics -- each via
#: ``asyncio.to_thread``), so two pool writers overlap during a run and a
#: loop-side write executes while the run's coroutine is suspended inside a
#: pool-side one. Cancellation widens it: cancelling a ``to_thread``
#: await DETACHES the worker rather than stopping it, so it finishes carrying a
#: read that is already stale.
#:
#: SCOPE -- ordinary ``update_state`` callers take the lock OFF-LOOP only.
#: Serializing every loop-side write by waiting would block the event loop behind
#: a pool thread's fsync, which the no-blocking anchor forbids. Retention promotion
#: instead probes the same per-agent lock non-blocking and returns RETRYABLE when
#: busy; once acquired, its existing on-loop keep write cannot be overwritten by
#: an older pool writer. Other on-loop callers keep their pre-existing unlocked
#: behavior -- see :func:`update_state` for the remaining limitation.
#:
#: The ordinary acquire is UNBOUNDED, and can be, because no on-loop caller reaches
#: it: only pool workers block there, and their own read + fsync + rename already
#: exposes them to a wedged filesystem. Promotion may hold the same lock around its
#: existing loop-side write, but its acquire is always non-blocking and never parks
#: the event loop.
#:
#: In-process only, mirroring the per-key ``threading.Lock`` registry this repo
#: already uses to serialize file read-modify-write (``learn._lock_for``,
#: ``artifacts._lock_for_root``, ``history.ConversationLog._file_locks``). A
#: filesystem lock is the tool for cross-process contention and there is none
#: here: every ``update_state`` caller lives in the gateway process that owns the
#: run. Keyed by agent id so unrelated runs never queue behind one agent's fsync,
#: SELF-CLEANING, with no explicit eviction anywhere. The values are held
#: WEAKLY and every caller keeps a strong reference for the length of its
#: critical section, so an entry lives exactly as long as some writer is using
#: it and then disappears on its own. That is a correctness property, not a
#: tidiness one: removing an entry explicitly while another writer still holds
#: or is queued on it SPLITS the lock's identity -- the next caller mints a
#: fresh lock and enters ``state.json`` alongside the writer still inside it,
#: which is the very loss this lock exists to prevent. Any hook that evicts
#: without holding the lock (a folder delete, the tombstone pruner) can do
#: exactly that, and the pruner's case is not even hypothetical: ``_atomic_write``
#: re-creates the parent directory, so a writer already inside its critical
#: section resurrects the folder the pruner just removed. Weak values make that
#: unrepresentable -- an entry cannot be dropped while anyone can still reach
#: it -- and agent ids are per-run uuids, so nothing accumulates either.

    the current state could not be read (missing/corrupt/unreadable). The skip
    is deliberate -- fabricating a fresh state here would resurrect a record
    the reaper deleted -- but callers with a durability contract (the pre-spawn
    provenance write) need to see the skip to retry rather than mistake
    a silent no-op for success.

    The read / merge / rewrite is serialized per agent for OFF-LOOP callers (see
    :data:`_STATE_LOCKS`), so two pool writers cannot rewrite a snapshot
    that predates the other's write.

    KNOWN LIMITATION: ordinary ON-LOOP callers do not take the lock, because waiting
    on a pool thread's fsync from the event loop is exactly the blocking call the
    repo's anchor forbids. Every writer inside a run goes off-loop through
    ``_write_state_off_loop`` and is drained on cancellation; an abandoned writer
    holds the conversation until it settles, so the
    on-loop retention writes are deferred past it. Retention promotion adds a
    second defense: on the event loop it probes the same per-agent lock
    non-blocking and returns RETRYABLE on contention, while off-loop promotion
    lets ``update_state`` acquire the lock normally. Thus no stale writer can
    roll back ``keep=True`` and no loop-side caller waits for a pool writer's
    fsync. The remaining on-loop callers are the synchronous retention writers;
    they still pay their own fsync on the loop, and moving that I/O while keeping
    their ``SessionMap`` mutation on-loop remains outstanding.
