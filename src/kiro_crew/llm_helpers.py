# side (kiro-cli

# warning, published on the provider (TURN_FALLBACK_ATTR) so the delivering
# surface can prepend a visible notice, and — on the interactive path —
# announced in chat (see dashboard/chat_runner). An empty chain (the default)
# disables the feature: behavior is byte-for-byte the pre-feature error surface.

# Attempts per fallback candidate: initial + ONE ~2s retry — deliberately NOT a
# fresh _TRANSIENT_RETRIES budget. Throttle-exhaustion events are often
# cell-scoped and model-agnostic (a frontend admission-tier outage takes out
# ALL models in the cell), so deep per-candidate retries mostly re-confirm a
# correlated outage slowly. One retry covers the uncorrelated single-shot 5xx
# on a healthy candidate while keeping the worst case bounded (~35s of backoff

# main thread exactly one tick on 3.10 and 3.12), so the hop yields between
# strings, never within one. The ceiling is therefore the liveness bound for a
# single string as well as the WORKER's: an unbounded string parks the loop and
# the thread for as long as the scan takes, and the permission request behind
# it -- the turn -- waits with it.
#
# The anchor rewrite in this change cut the constant but NOT the growth -- the
# scan is still superlinear in the length of one line. Measured on one dev box:
#
#     4 KiB 0.16s | 8 KiB 0.31s | 16 KiB 1.14s | 20 KiB 1.52s | 32 KiB 3.79s
#
# 16->32 KiB is 3.3x for 2x the input (~n^1.7), so extrapolation is the wrong
# instinct here and a ceiling has to be set from the measured curve. A CI runner
# under parallel load came in roughly an order of magnitude slower than this box,
# which is what sets the margin: 20 KiB is ~1.5s here and ~15s there, under the
# 25s loop watchdog on both.
#
# Exceeding it is FAIL-CLOSED: the call is denied, never skipped. A skip would
# convert a liveness bug into a security hole by letting unscanned input through
# the deny surface; a denial only refuses input we cannot prove safe, and is
# strictly better than the alternative it replaces, which was crashing the
# gateway and losing the whole turn.
#
# Known cost of that trade: a permission-gated write of a benign file larger

    is what ``event.tool_input`` carries. Handing it to :func:`_first_tool_input_denial`
    read the document as a shell command line, so writing a Markdown page that says

    that names ``~/.ssh`` was refused -- and a body over

    is the same defect class #9082 closed for cron script bodies: a document is not
    the shell gate's subject.

    What an edit can actually do is decided by WHERE it writes, so the gate for an
    edit is the resolved target path, exactly as ``hooks.on_tool_call`` decides it:
    every accepted path spelling in the params (``target_paths``) goes through
    :func:`is_sensitive_write_path`, which is the read+write keystone PLUS the
    write-only tier (config, the agents dir). A walk that hit its work cap is
    denied as unverifiable, mirroring the hook gate's fail-closed shape. The
    title-tier scan of the request still runs before this, unchanged.

    The target set is the UNION of the params' path spellings and *diff_path*,
    the path the tool_call's ``{"type": "diff"}`` content block named. A backend
    may stream trusted params that carry no path key at all and name the file
    only in that block (``_dispatch`` caches it per toolCallId onto the
    permission event as ``diff_path``), so judging the params alone would judge
    nothing. Fail-closed on an EMPTY union: an edit whose params and content
    block together name no target has no proven target to judge, and is denied
    rather than approved blind -- the document scan is not a fallback here,
    because a document that happens to contain no denied text is not evidence
    that the write is safe (#8812 is exactly a document being read as a
    command; #9082 is the same class). The caller only reaches this on trusted

    rejected-model fallback below is disabled. Callers whose RESULT is only
    meaningful on that exact model (e.g. the poisoned-conversation canary in

    served by that same model) must set it; ordinary best-effort callers

    ``sel_source`` to attribute the denial to their feature; callers that omit it

    themselves, while callers that surface the failure (title/nav) get it

    ``stream_and_collect`` breaks on ``EVENT_COMPLETE`` and returns only text,
    discarding the event's ``usage``. Background surfaces that dispatch through
    it (cron, heartbeat, autonudge, workflow, task-runner self-review) therefore
    have no event to hand :func:`persist_token_record_async`. This recovers the
    turn's billing and wraps it in a ``TurnUsage`` so it can be passed straight
    through as the ``event`` argument.

    A turn can span several attempts: ``stream_and_collect`` retries a busy
    session and a transient backend error, and each retry installs fresh per-turn
    stats. Reading the provider's live stats afterwards therefore sees only the
    LAST attempt and loses any earlier attempt that was already billed. So the
    total ``stream_and_collect`` accumulated is preferred when present, and
    consumed here -- one turn's billing is reported once. Callers that drive
    ``provider.stream`` themselves publish no total and fall back to the live
    read, which is what ``since`` guards (see :func:`_attempt_usage`).

    The total is published WITH the stats object it was computed from, and is
    accepted only while that object is still the provider's current one. The
    provider outlives the turn -- the shared background session is reused by every
    background caller, and a Slack session by every turn in its thread -- so a
    total left unread by one turn would otherwise be consumed by the next one,
    billing that turn's spend to the wrong surface and losing its own. Today every
    reader happens to be paired with a publish in the same turn, which makes the
    residue unreachable; the guard is here so that safety does not depend on the
    next caller preserving that pairing. A fresh turn installs fresh stats, so a
    stale total simply fails the identity check and the live read takes over.

    On the kiro (acp) seam the only non-zero per-turn billing signal is
    ``credits``; on the claude seam the token counts, cache fields, and
    ``cost_usd`` are filled instead. Whichever dimensions the turn's stats
    carried come through :meth:`to_turn_usage` intact. Providers that expose
    no stats (non-ACP backends, test doubles) yield an empty ``TurnUsage``

    Every background caller needs the same three steps around its prompt: acquire
    the shared session (which takes its per-session semaphore), release that
    semaphore in a ``finally`` or the next caller deadlocks on it, and recycle the
    session afterwards. Callers that hand-rolled those steps had no reason to also
    record what the turn cost, so background spend reached the provider's bill
    without ever reaching the usage store — invisible on the dashboard even though
    the account balance moved. Recording here makes it structural: a turn taken
    through this manager is accounted for, and a new background caller cannot
    forget to.

    ``task`` labels the work in the ``surface`` dimension as ``bg:<task>`` so spend
    is attributable per background job instead of pooling into one anonymous
    bucket. Keep it a short fixed label — never per-session text, which would make
    the dimension unbounded.

    ``agent`` is forwarded to ``get_or_create`` ONLY when a caller supplies it:
    the key decides which session is returned, but the agent decides what the
    session is created AS, so injecting a default here would silently change that
    for callers that deliberately pass none. The recorded row still names the
    background agent so the dimension is never blank.

    Exceptions are deliberately NOT swallowed. Callers distinguish "the session
    could not be acquired" (nothing was sent, so nothing was billed) from "the turn
    ran and failed" (billed), and collapsing the two corrupts the retry budgets
    built on that distinction. Only the accounting write is best-effort.

    """Stream a message through an LLM provider and collect the full response.

    This is the core pattern used by cron, heartbeat, subagent, consolidator,
    taskrunner, and title generation.

    Args:
        provider: The LLM provider to stream through.
        message: The prompt to send.
        approval_policy: How to handle tool permission requests.
        hooks: HookManager for HOOK_BASED approval policy.
        on_chunk: Optional callback invoked with each text chunk (for progress).
        on_tool_approval: Optional async callback for interactive approval.
        on_steer_consumed: Optional callback invoked with the backend's
            ``steering_consumed`` echo text. A mid-turn steer is a
            fire-and-forget write, so this echo is the ONLY authoritative signal
            that the backend injected it; a caller that steers must observe this
            to know which of its steers to requeue when the turn ends.
        on_complete: Optional callback invoked with the provider's raw
            ``EVENT_COMPLETE``. It is not invoked when the stream exhausts or
            the caller cancels before that event. Raising from the callback is
            swallowed so observation cannot fail the completed turn.
        on_tool_gate: Optional callback invoked once per tool permission
            decision with ``(tool_title, approved, security_blocked)``. Lets a
            caller tell "the model did work" apart from "every tool the model
            attempted was blocked" — a distinction the returned text cannot
            carry, because a model whose tools were all refused still returns
            plausible prose. ``security_blocked`` is True only for the
            unconditional deny checks (sensitive path, sensitive bash, a deny
            pattern); a governance ``TOOL_DENY`` and an unattended-approval
            timeout are refusals that say nothing about the job, so they arrive
            with ``approved=False`` and ``security_blocked=False``.
            Delivered when the attempt settles, not mid-stream, and decisions
            from an abandoned retry attempt are discarded: they describe work
            the final turn never did. ``tool_title`` is LLM-authored: redact it
            before display or persistence. Raising from the callback is
            swallowed; observing a gate decision must never fail the turn.
        retry_transient: When True (default), transient backend errors are
            retried in-place with bounded backoff. Set False from callers that
            already own an outer transient-retry loop, so the inner arm doesn't
            compound their attempts (retry-layer amplification).
        max_turns: Optional cap on tool-call iterations per prompt. When reached,
            the event loop breaks and returns whatever text has been collected.
            None (default) means no limit.
        session_key: Calling surface's session key, forwarded to the PreToolUse
            gate. Empty (default) preserves every existing caller's behavior.
        agent: Calling agent name, forwarded to the gate alongside *session_key*.
        app: Owning app name, forwarded to the gate so the app's governance
            PROFILE is resolved — not just the enterprise ceiling.

            All three matter for ``HOOK_BASED`` callers specifically. The gate
            resolves ``ceiling ∩ profile``, and it can only look up a profile it
            has been told the name of; with all three empty it applied the
            ceiling alone, so an app profile narrowing (say) ``filesystem.write``
            was silently not enforced for tools this helper approved. Callers
            using ``REJECT_ALL`` or ``AUTO_APPROVE`` are unaffected — the first
            runs no tools, the second never consults the gate.
        fallback_models: Ordered chain of model ids tried when the same-model
            transient budget exhausts on a throttle/capacity error (Case 2.75).
            Empty (the default) disables the chain — behavior is byte-for-byte
            today's fail-loudly. Requires ``retry_transient=True`` (a caller
            that owns the outer transient loop also owns any fallback policy).
            Every swap is logged at warning and published on the provider via
            :data:`TURN_FALLBACK_ATTR`; the swap is sticky for the session and
            a later call on the same provider probes one primary restore.

    Returns the ``ts`` of the row this turn ended on, read back INSIDE the atomic
    hold so it is this turn's own row and not some later writer's. A caller that
    stamps something with "how far the conversation had got" needs that value, and
    re-reading the tail afterwards is not the same thing: the permit for this
    session is released before the caller gets here, so a queued second turn can
    land its rows in between and the re-read would return ITS position. Taking the
    value under the lock we already hold costs nothing and removes the window
    rather than narrowing it.

    :func:`save_conversation_turn` makes TWO ``ConversationLog.append`` calls, and
    append acquires a cross-process flock and writes to disk -- ~12 ms each on a
    large transcript. Called directly from an ``async def`` that is worse than
    slow: on a running loop ``_locked`` makes a single NON-blocking acquire and
    raises :class:`~kiro_crew.history.HistoryLockTimeout` on any concurrent
    holder, and most callers swallow that, so the durable copy was dropped
    exactly when another writer was active. Off the loop the same primitive takes
    the patient poll-to-deadline path instead.

    This is the single choke point for every async caller, so the offload cannot
    be forgotten at a new call site and the ten Slack sites do not each restate
    it.

    Unlike :func:`~kiro_crew.history.append_off_loop`, this **awaits** the write
    rather than firing it at the executor and returning. That difference is
    deliberate: callers here go on to refresh a dashboard tab or hand the session
    to consolidation, both of which read the transcript back, so the turn has to
    be on disk before the caller continues. ``append_off_loop`` has no such
    reader and can afford to be fire-and-forget.

    The whole turn is written under one :meth:`~kiro_crew.history.ConversationLog.atomic_appends`
    hold. ``append`` locks per ROW, so without it two concurrent turns for the
    same session could interleave into ``user_A, user_B, assistant_A,
    assistant_B`` -- turns that do not pair up, which no timestamp ordering can
    repair because each row's ``ts`` is individually correct. On the loop that was
    impossible (a synchronous caller never yields between its two appends), so the
    hazard is introduced BY offloading and has to be closed here rather than
    inherited.
