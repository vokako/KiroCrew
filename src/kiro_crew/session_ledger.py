"""Per-session work ledger — durable loop state that lives on disk, not in context.

Long-horizon sessions (monitor loops, goal loops) accumulate their working
state as prior transcript turns, which the harness-owned compaction then
summarizes lossily. This module gives every session one small on-disk store
for that state instead: a mutable **state record** (goal, phase, next intent,
tried approaches, artifact pointers) carrying a bounded **event tail**. The
context window becomes a cache; the ledger is the authority.

Layout (see docs/system-specs/modules/session-work-ledger.md):

    <data_home>/ledger/<store-name>/
        slot_key        # breadcrumb: the exact ledger key this dir belongs to
        state.json      # the whole record, replaced atomically on every write
        .lock           # cross-process mutex inode (never replaced by writes)

Design notes:

- **One document, one atomic write.** State and its event land in the same
  ``atomic_write`` (temp file + rename), so a crash between "phase moved" and
  "event logged" cannot exist — the phase-requires-event invariant is
  crash-atomic by construction, not by ordering. The event tail is bounded
  (``_MAX_EVENTS``), so the file cannot grow without limit and every read is
  O(record), never O(history).
- **Exact-key identity.** :func:`ledger_key` only strips the dashboard
  prefixes (the same strip the permanent-delete funnel applies); it never
  folds the key's charset. Uniqueness comes from a digest over the exact key
  inside :func:`_store_name` — a lossy charset fold as the identity would map
  distinct channel session keys (colon-structured) onto one ledger.
- **Bounded lock.** The per-ledger lock acquire is a bounded poll and fails
  closed with ``OSError`` — a *live cross-process holder* of the flock costs
  one refused write, not an executor thread parked on it forever. The bound
  covers only what the deadline can reach: contention for an already-created
  lock inode. It does NOT cover a wedged filesystem/mount — the pre-lock
  ``mkdir``/``os.open`` are ordinary path/inode syscalls that a dead NFS mount
  or dying disk can stall unboundedly, and no in-process deadline can
  interrupt a stalled syscall. That mount-level failure is a distinct,
  out-of-scope failure mode, not a bound this code promises.
- **Size ceiling before parse.** A state file past ``_MAX_STATE_BYTES`` is
  treated as corrupt/absent rather than parsed, so a hostile or damaged file
  cannot make every nudge fire allocate its size.

Callers pass keys through :func:`ledger_key`; this module never imports
dashboard state.

    The lock file is a dedicated inode that writes never replace (replacing
    the locked inode would let a second writer lock the NEW inode and
    interleave). The acquire is a bounded poll over
    :func:`platform_compat.try_acquire_lock` — the repo's one non-blocking
    acquire primitive, covering POSIX and Windows alike — and FAILS CLOSED
    with ``OSError`` rather than entering the critical section unserialized.

    Scope of the bound (be precise — the docstring must not out-promise the
    code). ``_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECS`` bounds ONLY the ``try_acquire_lock`` poll
    loop below: against a *live cross-process holder* of the flock, this
    refuses with ``OSError`` instead of waiting forever. The deadline is
    checked between sleeps rather than during one, so the refusal lands within
    the budget plus at most one ``_LOCK_POLL_SECS`` interval — a bound, not an
    exact wall-clock cap.

    The pre-lock ``mkdir``/``os.open`` are ordinary path/inode syscalls; on a
    wedged filesystem (hard NFS mount, dying disk) they can stall unboundedly,
    and NO in-process deadline can interrupt them — SIGALRM is main-thread +
    POSIX-only (this runs on an ``asyncio.to_thread`` worker), a bounded
    dedicated-thread offload leaks an unkillable thread and a held fd on a
    hard hang, and ``O_NONBLOCK`` does not cover path-resolution/inode stalls
    (only FIFO/device opens). A wedged mount is therefore explicitly OUT OF
    SCOPE of this lock's deadline, not a bound this contextmanager promises.

    The deadline is established immediately before the poll it governs and is
    NOT hoisted above ``mkdir``/``os.open`` — hoisting would spend the budget
    on the pre-lock syscalls and leave a near-zero retry window for genuine
    contention, which is the inversion that must not recur.

    funnel may not hold once the slot is gone. This sweep closes that gap:
    it walks the ledger root, reads each directory's ``slot_key`` breadcrumb,

    under the caller-supplied *fold* (the transcript-filename fold, so the

    ledger it names). The fold is used only to MATCH deletion targets, never
    as storage identity; in the rare case two exact keys share a folded
    spelling, both ledgers are removed — acceptable for disposable state,
    where the alternative is one of them silently surviving its session.

    root holds one directory per session that ever recorded, so the walk is
