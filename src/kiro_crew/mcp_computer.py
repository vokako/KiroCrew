"""MCP server exposing the computer-use tools — a THIN SHIM over the gateway.

Runs as ``kirocrew mcp-computer``: kiro-cli spawns it as a child process and calls
tools via JSON-RPC over stdio. Unlike ``mcp_cron`` / ``mcp_core``, this server
implements **nothing**. It

1. resolves the caller's session identity STRICTLY, and
2. forwards the call to the gateway over loopback with the internal-secret
   handshake — the same pattern ``mcp_core`` already uses for its own gateway
   round-trips.

All governance evaluation, all accessibility / screen-capture work, and all SEL
auditing happen IN THE GATEWAY (``computer_use/tools.py`` →
``computer_use/gate.py``). Three reasons, each load-bearing:

* **The authorization point must be fail-closed.**
  ``hooks._governance_denial`` — the PreToolUse gate — is fail-**OPEN** by
  deliberate repo policy (a governance glitch must not wedge every tool call on
  every surface), so it cannot be the sole authorization point for a surface that
  can read a password field's ``AXValue``. The fail-CLOSED gate is the keystone
  primary enable, read at the top of ``computer_use/tools.py``'s ordered
  chokepoint: a keystone that is missing, unreadable or disabled refuses the call
  outright. ``gate.require_computer_use`` is audit-only — it unconditionally
  permits and records the call, retained as the one place a future edition can
  reintroduce a decision without touching every call site — and the refusals
  downstream of the enable (the operator's target policy, the element and pointer
  shape checks) need the OS-resolved app identity and the addressed element's
  role, which only the gateway-side tool body has.
* **Governance and the audit trail live where the platform context is composed.**
  The ceiling, the profile store and the SEL trust root are all gateway state.
* **No native code in this process.** This module imports no ctypes, loads no
  framework, and touches no accessibility API — so a driver fault can never take
  down the process kiro-cli is talking to, and this file is byte-identical in
  behavior on macOS, Linux and Windows.

Identity is resolved with :func:`mcp_core._resolve_session_key_strict` — the
gateway-injected per-call caller block first (this server advertises
``kirocrew.caller-identity``, so gatewayd injects one whenever it can name the
caller — the only identity source that works on a pooled backend serving many
sessions), then the env var, then ``KIROCREW_HOST_PID`` plus the HMAC sidecar
signed with the keystone-protected ``sel_hmac.key``. The lenient resolver is
deliberately NOT used: it walks ``/proc`` ancestors over
``session_pid_<pid>.txt``, which ``mcp_core`` itself documents as
"agent-writable and therefore forgeable".

**An unresolved key is NOT a refusal.** The call proceeds, carrying the
per-process ``UNRESOLVED_SESSION_PREFIX`` placeholder rather than a guessed
identity — and rather than the empty string, which would alias every unresolved
session onto one ``SnapshotIndex`` slot (see that constant for the aliasing bug).
Neither accepted source exists for a GUI-launched kiro-cli on macOS —
``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` reaches a child only from a launcher that already knows
which session it spawns for (the ACP spawn path in ``acp/client.py``, the
script-cron launcher in ``cron_script.py``) and ``KIROCREW_HOST_PID`` only from the
Linux sandbox launcher (``sandbox.py``), and a GUI launch has neither above it — so
gating on identity made the feature unusable on its only supported platform. The
unattended-surface rule was removed by product decision; "we cannot name the
session" must not become "you may not drive the desktop". What is lost is audit
ATTRIBUTION, not a control: the trail records that the session could not be named,
which is honest, where the lenient walk would have recorded a forgeable name.

Tool visibility follows the keystone primary enable: ``tools/list`` returns ``[]``
while computer use is off, so a disabled feature is invisible to the model rather
than a set of tools that always refuse.

# Identity used when neither accepted source resolves — which is the NORMAL case on
# macOS, the only platform with a driver. Which launchers supply each source, and why
# a GUI launch has neither, is stated once in the module docstring.
#
# Why this exists rather than an empty string: ``SnapshotIndex`` namespaces its
# entries by
# ``(session_key, window_key)``, so EVERY unresolved session shared the single
# ``("", window)`` slot. Two concurrent macOS sessions observing the same window
# therefore overwrote each other's element indices — and each one's own
# fingerprint check would still pass, because the two trees are of the same window.
# The result is a wrong-target action with nothing reporting it, which is the worst
# class this feature can produce.
#
# The fix is a per-PROCESS identity, not a refusal. kiro-cli spawns one shim process
# per session, so in the 1:1 shim topology the pid separates the namespaces exactly
# as far as the sessions are actually separate — and it does so without reinstating
# the unattended-surface refusal that was removed by product decision. On a POOLED
# backend one process serves many sessions, so the pid alone separates only what the
# injected caller block does not already name: co-tenants gatewayd can name get real
# per-session keys, and the unnamed ones would otherwise collapse onto one
# ``unresolved:<pid>`` namespace. gatewayd injects a
# per-CONNECTION nonce on every forwarded call, which is appended here, so two
# unnamed co-tenants of one pooled process hold separate namespaces. It is
# deliberately NOT presented as trustworthy attribution: the prefix names it as
# unresolved so an audit reader cannot mistake a pid (or a nonce) for a session
# identity.

    ``unresolved:<pid>`` of THIS shim process, plus ``#<nonce>`` of the calling
    CONNECTION when the gateway supplied one. Together they separate two
    unresolved sessions exactly as far as they really are separate, in both
    topologies:

    * 1:1 shim (no gateway, no nonce) — kiro-cli spawns one shim per session, so
      the pid is already the separator and the key is unchanged.
    * Pooled backend — one process serves N connections, so the pid separates
      nothing; the gateway-minted per-connection nonce does.

    Without the nonce half, two unnamed co-tenants of a pooled backend share one
    key, which lets ``SnapshotIndex``'s ``(session_key, window_key)``
    namespace alias them onto one entry and one session's action resolve
    against another's element indices — while each session's own fingerprint
    check still passed, because both trees describe the same window.

    Both halves are read at CALL time rather than captured at import: a ``fork``ed
    child would otherwise inherit the parent's pid string and re-alias with it,
    and the nonce belongs to the call in flight, not to the process.

    Never presented as trustworthy attribution — the prefix says so. This is a
    namespace separator, not an authenticated identity; a genuine identity still
    comes only from the two sources ``_resolve_session_key_strict`` accepts, and

#: Whether this server advertises ``kirocrew.caller-identity`` — i.e. whether it
#: consumes the per-call caller block gatewayd injects instead of reading identity
#: from its own process. True here because it does: the session key forwarded to
#: the gateway comes from :func:`mcp_core._resolve_session_key_strict`, whose
#: first source is that block.
#:
#: Advertising is not cosmetic. ``mcp_gateway/backend.py`` strips any client-forged
#: caller block from EVERY forwarded request and re-injects its own only when the
#: backend advertised this capability — so without the advertisement the block
#: never arrives, and this server's resolver reads an empty identity no matter how
#: correctly it is written. Nothing declines to POOL an unadvertised backend
#: (``rewriter.UNPOOLABLE_SERVERS`` is empty and documents that the capability is
#: read only to decide injection), so the unadvertised state was not "per-session
#: spawn" — it was pooled AND identity-blind. For this server that silently
#: degraded every pooled call to the unresolved-identity path: the call still
#: proceeds (by product decision), but the audit trail loses attribution it was
#: built to carry.
#:
#: A module-level constant rather than a bare argument below so the value is
#: readable without executing :func:`run_mcp_server`, and so
#: ``test/test_mcp_managed_caller_identity.py`` can assert it against the argument
#: actually handed to the shim.
