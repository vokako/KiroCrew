"""systemd system-service generation and control for Linux.

The unit lives at ``/etc/systemd/system/kirocrew.service`` and is
enabled+started via ``sudo systemctl enable --now``. The service runs
as the invoking user (via ``User=`` in the unit) — only the install,
uninstall, and start/stop actions need sudo.

Why system-level instead of user-level (``systemctl --user``):
some older distros (notably systemd 219) do not have a working
per-user systemd manager — ``systemctl --user`` fails with
``Failed to get D-Bus connection``. System-level units work
uniformly across any distro shipping systemd >= 219, which is
everything since 2015.

One host class this choice does NOT work on, and cannot be made to work by
anything the installer writes: an SELinux-enforcing host whose kirocrew lives
under ``$HOME`` (the default on Bazzite, Fedora Silverblue/Kinoite and other
atomic desktops). PID 1's domain is denied ``execute`` on a home-labelled file,
so the unit fails every start with ``203/EXEC`` (#7165). :mod:`kiro_crew.service
.selinux` detects exactly that case by querying the loaded policy, and
:func:`install` refuses up front with a rendered user-scope unit as the remedy
rather than writing a unit that provably cannot start. A per-user install mode is
the real fix and is deliberately NOT implemented here — it is an install-model
change (scope-aware status/restart/uninstall, where the AppArmor profile and the
root-owned overrides file live) rather than a mechanical one.

Sudo scope: this file escalates ``systemctl``, ``install``, ``mkdir``,
``rm``, ``rmdir`` and ``test`` directly, and lends its privileged helpers
to ``service/apparmor.py``, which adds ``apparmor_parser``, ``aa-exec``,
and — inside ``aa-exec`` — ``setpriv`` plus a trusted system ``python3``.

What each mechanism here buys is narrower than it reads, and for ``setpriv`` it
depends on which install path is running — that gap is where an audit of this
module goes wrong.

Trusted resolution buys one thing, on both paths: the interpreter is root-owned,
resolved from a fixed list of trusted system directories, and never
``sys.executable`` — which rules out escalating the venv python, the one that is
user-writable. It says nothing about what that interpreter then loads. Invoked
without ``-I``/``-S``, CPython prepends the caller's working directory to
``sys.path`` and imports ``site``, so code from that working directory,
``PYTHONPATH``, a user-site ``.pth`` line, ``sitecustomize`` or ``usercustomize``
runs before or during the payload's own first import — ``ctypes``, which a planted
module on any of those paths shadows.

WHOSE privileges that loaded code gets is what ``setpriv`` decides, and both
install paths are live. It reuids to the account the INSTALLER was invoked as
(``os.getuid()``): started as an ordinary user — the default, where this module
escalates individual commands through ``sudo`` — it reuids from sudo's root back
to that user, so the probe and anything it loads stay unprivileged; started as
``sudo kirocrew service install`` it reuids to 0, which is a no-op, and only on
that path does the loaded code run as root.

What IS bounded on both paths is the PAYLOAD: a constant stdlib snippet importing
no ``kiro_crew``, so no MCP / LLM / agent code is reached deliberately.

``docs/system-specs/modules/security.md`` carries the reasoning behind the
AppArmor step's four tools. The actual gateway runs as ``User=$USER`` once
started.
