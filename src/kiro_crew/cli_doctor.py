    Spec emission consults each managed server's ``spec_gate``
    (``agent._MANAGED_MCP_SERVERS``): a closed gate means the ``mcpServers``
    entry is deliberately omitted from every emitted spec — and retracted from
    an existing one on refresh — so on such a host the entry's absence is the
    HEALTHY state, not a broken install. Doctor's static checks must consult
    the same predicate or the two sides drift apart, producing the unfixable
    "missing from mcpServers (re-run `kirocrew setup`)" loop on every host
    where the gate is closed. Resolving the gate through the registry
    keeps them pinned together: a future server gaining a gate needs no edit
    here, and a server without one reports open, exactly as emission treats it.

    The ``except`` covers gate-CONTRACT failures only — a registry entry that
    is not a dict, or a gate callable that raises past its own handling. For
    those, the fail direction is deliberately the OPPOSITE of emission's
    ``agent._gated_off_servers()``: there, a gate that raises is treated as
    closed, because the open position hands out a backend the operator may not
    want running; here it reports NOT closed, because "closed" is what
    silences the missing-entry error. Each side fails toward its own safe
    state. Note the scope honestly: the shipped computer-use gate catches its
    own internal errors and ANSWERS ``False`` (its documented fail-closed
    posture — an unreadable keystone must never hand out the desktop), so an
    unreadable keystone is indistinguishable from policy-closed through the
    boolean, by the gate's own design. That answer is still the
    emission-CONSISTENT one to report: in that state the entry genuinely is
    omitted from every emitted spec, so the ℹ️ line describes what the system
    actually does, even when the underlying cause is a broken enable-state
    read rather than a decision.

    Never loads a native driver: the computer-use gate reads only the enable
    keystone and platform flags (see ``agent._computer_use_spec_gate``), which
    is what makes it safe to evaluate on doctor's diagnostic path.

       ``mcpServers`` and ``tools``. A gated-off server (feature disabled, or

# The dashboard already surfaces a failing job per-row (an `err` badge on
# `last_status === 'error'`, with `last_error` on hover), and the gateway
# re-alerts on a still-failing job hourly. Both of those run INSIDE the
# gateway, so neither can speak when the gateway is the thing that is wedged.
# Doctor is a separate process the user runs by hand, which is why the scan
# reads `crons.json` off disk rather than asking the gateway's HTTP API: a check
# whose purpose is to survive a down gateway must not depend on one.
#
# It also covers a gap the dashboard has by construction: the status badge is
# rendered under an `enabled` guard, so a job that auto-paused shows only
# "paused" and its error state is not displayed at all.
#
# The scan itself lives in `cron.unhealthy_jobs_from_disk` so the pause-state
# predicates keep the single owner `cron.py` declares for them; this module owns
# only the presentation.
#
# Read-only, like the rest of doctor: an auto-paused job has failed
# `_AUTO_PAUSE_THRESHOLD` times in a row and is usually paused for a good
# reason, so silently resuming it during a diagnostic would hide the very
# problem the user ran doctor to find. The remediation is a `Fix:` hint naming
