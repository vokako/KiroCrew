"""Loopback HTTP requests with proxies and redirects disabled.

Every request Kiro Crew makes to its own gateway carries ``X-Internal-Secret``,
which authorises write endpoints on the local dashboard. ``urlopen`` builds its
opener from ``getproxies()``, and urllib has **no implicit loopback exemption**:
``proxy_bypass_environment`` returns ``False`` when ``no_proxy`` is unset, and
``ProxyHandler.proxy_open`` bypasses only the hosts ``no_proxy`` names outright.
So with ``HTTP_PROXY`` set -- routine in corporate and containerised
environments -- a request to ``http://127.0.0.1:5476`` is sent to the proxy in
absolute form, secret header included, in cleartext.

Two things that look like fixes and are not:

* Spelling the host ``127.0.0.1`` instead of ``localhost``. That addresses
  ``localhost`` resolving to ``::1`` past a v4-only listener -- a real problem,
  a different one. Both spellings proxy identically.
* Setting ``no_proxy=localhost``. ``no_proxy`` matches the host **string**, not
  what it resolves to, so a request to the literal IP still proxies. That
  spelling is the common corporate default, which makes it the more dangerous
  of the two: it looks like coverage.

Redirects are refused for the same reason the external bearer-token path in
``dashboard/handlers/kiro_usage_api.py`` refuses them -- a 3xx from the gateway
would replay the secret to whatever host ``Location`` names.

This module is a **stdlib-only leaf** and must stay one: it imports only
standard-library modules (``urllib.request``, ``http.client``, ``os``,
``socket``) and nothing from ``kiro_crew``. That is what lets the cheapest
callers use it -- ``cron_trigger`` imports nothing from ``kiro_crew`` at all,
and the MCP stdio proxies deliberately avoid importing the gateway, since
reaching ``parse_dashboard_url`` through ``dashboard.origin`` costs ~605 ms and
1124 modules (see the ``dashboard/urls.py`` docstring). Adding an import here
that pulls aiohttp in behind it would defeat the point.

    The transport twin of :func:`loopback_urlopen` for callers whose request

    no TCP handler in this opener at all, so "no fallback" is structural rather
    than a flag someone can invert: a socket that is missing, stale, or refusing
    raises ``URLError`` and the request is not sent anywhere else.

    That distinction is the whole point. ``loopback_urlopen`` retries over TCP
    when nobody answers the socket, which is right for its callers -- they are
    reaching a gateway whose port they already trust, and a socket file left by a
    dead gateway should not break them. It is wrong for ``pod api``: a pod's port
    is ordinary loopback that any local user can bind the moment the pod
    releases it, so a TCP retry can hand the pod's minted token to whatever
    answered. A unix socket cannot be answered by another user, because it lives
    inside the pod's owner-only home.

    *socket_path* is trusted (derived, never caller-supplied); the URL's host is
    preserved, so the gateway's Host validation sees exactly what it would on
    TCP.

    Drop-in for ``urllib.request.urlopen`` at loopback call sites, with one
    deliberate difference: ``timeout`` is **required**. A request to our own
    gateway that can hang forever is never what a call site wants, and making
    it explicit costs nothing -- every existing loopback site already passes
    one.

    When *unix_socket_path* is given and the file exists, the request is sent
    over that ``AF_UNIX`` socket instead of TCP (the URL -- and therefore the
    ``Host`` header -- is unchanged). This lets the gateway kernel-verify the
    caller's identity via ``SO_PEERCRED``; see ``dashboard/token_auth``. The
    TCP fallback triggers ONLY when nobody answers on the socket at connect
    time (``FileNotFoundError`` / ``ConnectionRefusedError``, i.e. a stale
    file left by a dead gateway): those cases provably never delivered the
    request, so retrying over TCP cannot double-send. Any later failure --
    an HTTP error status, a read timeout, a reset mid-response -- propagates
    exactly as it would on TCP, keeping every caller's error shape unchanged.

    A caller that must NOT fall back -- because its request carries a credential
    another process could capture on the port -- wants
    :func:`unix_socket_urlopen` instead. Do not add a "require unix" flag here:
    the guarantee then depends on a conditional every future edit can invert,
    and the callers below all want the fallback.

    The opener is rebuilt per call rather than cached at module scope. Both
    handlers are stateless, so a cache would be safe for the FIXED code -- but
    it would capture ``getproxies()`` at import time, making the module's
    behaviour depend on when it was first imported and silently defeating any
    test that sets a proxy variable afterwards. That is not hypothetical: with a
    cached opener the regression tests pass even with ``ProxyHandler({})``
    deleted. Constructing a few stateless
    handlers is far cheaper than the loopback round trip that follows.

    Use this for the local gateway ONLY. External requests must keep the
    default opener, because they genuinely need the corporate proxy to leave
    the host.
