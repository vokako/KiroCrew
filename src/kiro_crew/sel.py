"""Security Event Log — immutable, tamper-evident audit trail for tool invocations.

Records structured JSON events for every tool/MCP action with:
- Timestamp (ISO 8601 UTC)
- Caller identity (session key, agent, source interface)
- Operation type (tool_call, tool_approved, tool_rejected, tool_denied, mcp_call)
- Resources affected (tool name, tool kind, arguments summary)
- Outcome (approved, rejected, denied, completed, failed)
- Downstream service (MCP server name if applicable)
- HMAC-SHA256 integrity chain (each entry signs over previous hash)

Storage: ``<config_dir>/security_events.jsonl`` (append-only JSONL); the HMAC
signing key lives OUTSIDE the log directory in ``<config_dir>/trust/`` so an
actor who can rewrite the log dir cannot also read the key and re-sign a
clean-looking chain.
Rotation: the live log is closed at ``_SEGMENT_MAX_BYTES`` and renamed into
``<config_dir>/security_events.d/``, keeping ``_SEGMENT_KEEP`` closed segments.
Each segment is an INDEPENDENT HMAC chain (it starts from genesis), and the
first record of every new live log is a ``sel_rotation`` event naming the
segment just closed and its size — deliberately NOT that segment's final
``entry_hash``, which a sibling process still holding a writable fd to the
renamed inode could invalidate, making verification report an untampered log as
compromised. The segment NAME is what lets an investigator walk the sequence, so
the boundary is auditable evidence rather than a chain break, and retention
deleting an old segment leaves every surviving segment verifiable on its own.
Retention: configurable, default 365 days per Amazon Security Event Logging Standard.

        """Serialize the read-tip → chain → append sequence across PROCESSES.

        ``_lock`` is a ``threading.Lock``, so it only orders writers inside one
        interpreter. The gateway and each managed MCP server are separate
        processes sharing one log file, and each holds its own singleton with
        its own cached tip — so two of them chain off the same ``prev_hash``,
        and because each only ever advances its OWN cache the two lineages fork
        permanently, making verify_integrity() report every later entry from the
        losing process as tampered. ``O_APPEND`` guarantees no torn or
        overwritten bytes; it guarantees nothing about the read-compute-append
        sequence, which is what the chain depends on.

        The sidecar lives in the trust subdirectory, not beside the log: that
        directory is owner-only and inside the sensitive-path floor, whereas a
        sibling of ``security_events.jsonl`` is not covered by its exact-leaf
        deny-list entry. An audited agent able to unlink the sidecar mid-hold
        would leave two writers holding locks on different inodes — the very
        fork this serialization exists to prevent — and one able to hold it
        could wedge every writer.

        On the asyncio event-loop thread the acquire is a SINGLE nonblocking
        attempt that then fails closed, because waiting there — even a short
        poll spin — stalls chat and the heartbeat for every session the loop
        serves, and ``prune`` holds this lock across a whole streaming rewrite.
        A refused acquire raises, which ``_flush_batch`` already turns into a
        rollback plus warning — or into a propagated error for a critical audit,
        which is the audit-or-deny contract working rather than a stalled
        gateway. Off the loop (the background writer thread, and ``prune`` in an
        executor) the acquire waits normally, which is where routine overlap
        between processes is absorbed.

        Callers must take this lock BEFORE ``_lock``, in both write paths. The
        reverse order lets a cross-process wait stall the loop indirectly: a
        writer thread holding ``_lock`` while it waits here leaves a loop-side
        critical audit blocking on ``_lock``, which has no fail-closed gate of
        its own.

        SAME-PROCESS callers JOIN the one hold instead of contending. flock is
        per open file description, so a second fd opened in this process --
        another thread of this instance, or a SIBLING instance on the same
        directory -- reads its own process as a foreign writer, and the
        loop-side single shot then fails a critical audit closed against our
        own background writer mid-batch (measured twice: the fingerprint
        read's terminal audit racing the writer flushing the same call's
        earlier best-effort event, and the issue-radar trust tests failing
        whenever a sibling instance's writer held the lock). The hold registry
        is therefore MODULE-level, keyed by lock path, and each hold carries a
        gate that serializes the critical sections of holders and joiners --
        instances do not share ``_lock``, so the gate is what keeps a
        cross-instance join chain-safe. What a loop-side joiner waits on is
        one append's bounded local disk work; the heavy holds are refused by
        label instead: ``prune`` (``kind="prune"``) spans a whole streaming
        rewrite, and rotation relabels the hold for its step

        Caller holds the cross-process chain lock AND ``_lock``. The tip is
        rolled back on any failure so a record never chains off a hash that was
        not persisted.

        The retry survives under the chain lock because the lock orders sibling
        APPENDS, not everything that can move the file: this instance's cached
        tip is stale when a sibling appended before we took the lock, and a
        sibling's ROTATION — serialized by the rotation lock, not this one —
        can rename the file between our chaining and our open. In both cases
        the append VALIDATES the file it opened and re-chains — see
        :meth:`_append_lines_locked`.

        EVERY attempt is validated, including the last. When the retries are
        exhausted the batch is NOT written; :class:`SelChainContention` is raised.

        An earlier revision wrote the final attempt unguarded, reasoning that a
        missing audit record is worse than one suspect chain link. That was wrong
        twice over. A knowingly-broken link does not read as "one imperfect
        record" -- it makes ``security verify`` report the log as COMPROMISED, and
        an investigator cannot tell that false signal apart from real tampering.
        This PR already deleted the rotation record's predecessor-hash claim on
        exactly that principle (a check that can fire on a benign cause is worse
        than no check); writing a bad link is the same mistake with the sign
        flipped. And it invented a third behaviour: this class already answers an
        unwritable audit by DENYING the action (``critical=True``, audit-or-deny)
        or by dropping the batch with a warning (best-effort) -- never by writing
        something it knows to be corrupt.

        Raising an ``OSError`` subclass is what routes it correctly with no new
        plumbing: a critical caller re-raises and refuses the action it was about
        to audit, and the background writer treats it exactly as it already treats
        a full disk.

        """Rotate if the live log is at the cap, holding the lock over the body.

        Caller holds ``_lock``. The body is the caller's chain + append.

        Below the cap -- the overwhelmingly common case -- this is a single
        ``stat`` and no lock at all, so a normal append pays nothing.

        At the cap it takes a CROSS-PROCESS lock, because ``_lock`` is a thread
        lock and SEVERAL PROCESSES share one data home (the gateway, the CLI,
        cron), all appending to this same file. They therefore reach the cap at
        the same moment, and two things go wrong unserialized:

        * both pick the same target name, and the second ``os.replace`` moves the
          freshly recreated live log onto the segment the first just closed,
          destroying it;
        * the loser keeps its pre-rotation chain tip and appends from it, so its
          first record in the new log names a ``prev_hash`` that is not in that
          file and ``security verify`` reports an untampered log as compromised.

        The acquire is NON-BLOCKING and the whole window is best-effort. A
        critical (``audit-or-deny``) event is written INLINE on its caller's
        thread, and some of those callers are event-loop coroutines, so a
        blocking acquire here could park the loop on another process's rotation —
        the ``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`` hazard. Rotation is never worth
        that: it is deferrable (the next batch retries) while an audit write is
        not.

        Skipping on contention does NOT leave the loser appending from a stale
        tip, which is the reason the lock spans the append at all: the contended
        path re-checks the live log's identity and re-anchors the tip immediately
        before the caller chains (see :meth:`_reanchor_if_replaced`). A rotation
        that lands between that check and the append is the residual, a
        cross-process interleaving race -- closing THAT means holding a
        cross-process lock
        across every audit write, which is both the event-loop hazard above and
        a hot-path cost.

        Every failure -- an uncreatable/planted segment dir, a planted or
        unopenable lock file -- yields WITHOUT rotating so the audit record still
        lands.

        Why it is needed: several processes share one data home and append to this
        file, each caching its own tip in ``_last_hash`` and never re-reading it.
        When ANOTHER process rotates, this process's next append usually does not
        see the cap at all (the live log is small and fresh), so it never enters
        the rotation window — and it would chain its record off a tip that now
        lives inside the closed segment. Unlike the pre-existing interleaving
        race, which needs two appends to actually collide, that break is
        GUARANTEED for every process after every foreign rotation, so rotation
        must not leave it standing.

        Detection needs no lock and no extra syscall. The live log is append-only,
        so it can never shrink: a smaller size than we last wrote means the file
        was replaced. ``st_ino`` catches the same event where the filesystem
        reports it (a fresh file gets a new inode), and is skipped when either
        side reports 0 — some Windows filesystems do not supply a file index.

        The residual after this is a rotation landing
        between this stat and our append. Closing THAT means holding a
        cross-process lock across every audit write, a hot-path cost,

        ALSO be a real regular file: the name check is what protects an
        operator's file, the ``lstat`` check is the cheap first filter that
        stops a PLANTED link from being read as audit history. It judges the
        dirent at SCAN time only, so the readers re-validate at open time via
        :func:`_open_segment` — a link planted between scan and open is refused
        there rather than followed. A hardlink ALIAS is deliberately NOT
        deduplicated: every key such a decision could use is
        attacker-controlled here, so a dedupe lets a planted name DISPLACE the
        real segment (see the comment at the scan); an alias's worst case is
        repeating already-signed records, which admission gating bounds.

        The link case is reachable on an upgrade and matters on the read side,
        not the delete side: ``security_events.d`` was not on the sensitive-path
        floor before this release, so an agent could have pre-planted
        ``security_events-000001-<stamp>.jsonl`` as a symlink to any file it
        wanted surfaced -- and every reader here (``recent``, which backs the
        dashboard's SEL events endpoint, and ``verify_integrity``) would parse
        the LINKED file's lines and hand back whatever JSON objects it found as
        events. Retention unlinking such an entry would only remove the link,
        but the read is a real disclosure, so a non-regular entry is excluded.

        Ordering is by the name's numeric sequence — see ``_SEGMENT_NAME_RE``
        for why that rather than the timestamp or the mtime.

        Enumeration is BOUNDED at ``_SEGMENT_SCAN_CAP`` entries. Rotation keeps
        at most ``_SEGMENT_KEEP + 1`` files here, so any larger count is either an
        operator's dumping ground or entries planted before this release, and this
        walk runs on the append path — where a critical audit is written inline,
        sometimes on the event loop. An unbounded listing of a directory someone
        else filled would stall that caller
        (``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop``), so the scan stops at the cap and
        works with what it has: rotation then simply does not find the segments
        beyond it, which leaves the log over budget rather than blocking a write.

        *pin* is the read-side directory pin. The walk itself stays
        the same bounded, BY-NAME scan on every platform — the cap above is
        the memory bound, and materializing an unbounded listing first (as an
        fd-relative ``os.listdir`` would) would spend unbounded memory just to
        refuse it afterwards. The pin closes the redirect the name allows:
        after the walk, the path must still name the directory the read
        pinned (any swap — planted link, or a different real directory, whose
        identity also differs — fails closed to no segments), and on
        descriptor platforms the per-file opens that follow resolve RELATIVE
        to the pinned descriptor, so a swap after the revalidation still
        cannot redirect a read. Rotation calls this UNPINNED: it repairs the

        the hot path. If the writer can't be started (unexpected), fall back to

        audit, or the caller's fail-closed branch becomes unreachable.

        A critical write also does not rotate, and neither does the
        writer-unavailable fallback below: both run inline on their caller's
        thread, which may be the asyncio event loop. ``_may_rotate`` enforces that

        Every rotated segment (oldest first) is verified BEFORE the live log.
        Each file is an independent chain that starts from genesis, so a segment
        deleted by retention cannot make a surviving one look tampered — which is
        the property rotation had to preserve.

        There is deliberately no cross-file assertion. Forgery is caught per
        RECORD: a planted or rewritten segment cannot produce a valid HMAC because
        the key lives outside the log directory, so its entries are counted invalid
        here regardless of what any boundary record says. An earlier revision also
        checked a predecessor-hash claim carried in the rotation record; see
        :meth:`_rotation_event` for why that claim cannot be made true without
        serializing every append, and why a check that can fire on a benign cause
        is worse than no check.

        Segments are enumerated under a read-side directory pin: the
        segment dir that refused to pin (a planted link, or not a directory)
        contributes NOTHING here rather than being walked by name — which is
        what makes a swapped ``security_events.d`` fail closed instead of
        inflating ``total`` with another tree's files (a false tamper alarm).

        ``detailed=True`` adds the third outcome that refusal needs:
        ``history_verifiable=False`` with a ``reason`` when the
        directory refused to pin or was replaced mid-verification, because
        the rotated segments were not checked and "intact over the live log

        Streams the log line-by-line to bound memory usage, writes survivors
        to a temp file, then atomically replaces the original. The append lock
        is held across the whole read+replace critical section so a concurrent
        append cannot land in the old file after the read pass and be lost by
        the replace: appends either complete before the read (and are copied)
        or block until after the replace (and land in the new file). Both the
        cross-process chain lock and the thread lock are held, in that order —
        a writer in ANOTHER process is ordered only by the former, and taking it
        first is what keeps a cross-process wait off the event loop. Appends
        run on the background writer thread, so blocking them for the prune
        duration never touches the event loop.

        The chain lock orders sibling APPENDS; rotation by a sibling is ordered
        by the cross-process ROTATION lock (the same one rotation takes), which
        the live sweep additionally holds via :meth:`_prune_live_locked`. The

        in the old file after the read pass would be dropped by the replace —
        the only path in this class that can lose already-persisted audit
        events. Unlike rotation, prune WAITS for the rotation lock instead of
        skipping. Rotation is deferrable and runs on the audit hot path; prune
        is a once-a-day sweep on the maintenance executor, never on the event
        loop, and skipping it would postpone retention for a whole day. When
        the lock cannot be taken at all the live sweep is skipped and reported,

    what a directory entry WAS when scanned; this opener judges what the name
    IS at open time, closing the scan->open window in which a substitute can
    be planted (the read-side TOCTOU). Segments are the enumerated,
    attacker-nameable surface; the LIVE log deliberately does not come here —
    its writer follows an operator's symlink, so its readers must too
    (:meth:`SecurityEventLog._reader_handle` owns that split).

    With a *pin* the final DIRECTORY hop is pinned too: the open (and
    the identity check below) resolve RELATIVE to the pinned descriptor where
    the platform has directory descriptors, so a ``security_events.d`` swapped
    after the pin cannot redirect the open into another tree; where it does
    not, the pin's directory identity is revalidated against the path first,
    refusing a swapped parent mid-read. The per-file funnel below is otherwise
    unchanged.

    Three layers, each covering what the previous one cannot:

    - ``O_NOFOLLOW`` fails a planted symlink at the open itself where the
      platform has it (``ELOOP`` on Linux/macOS; some BSDs say ``EMLINK`` or
      ``EFTYPE``). ``O_NONBLOCK`` is load-bearing for a planted FIFO: without
      it the read-side ``os.open`` blocks until a writer appears, before any
      descriptor-level check is reachable; it has no effect on regular files.
      Both degrade to 0 via ``getattr`` on Windows, and ``O_BINARY`` keeps the
      descriptor out of Windows text mode there.
    - ``fstat`` on the DESCRIPTOR — which nothing can swap afterwards —
      requires a regular file, refusing FIFOs, directories, and device nodes
      on every platform.
    - An identity check makes the flag degradation safe: the opened file must
      be exactly the file *path* names right now (``lstat`` dev/ino equal to
      the descriptor's). A symlink's own ``lstat`` identity never equals its
      target's, so a symlink swap is refused even where ``O_NOFOLLOW`` does
      not exist, and a mid-swap mismatch fails closed. (On a filesystem that
      reports ``st_ino == 0`` for everything, the comparison degrades to the
      flag and type checks; such filesystems do not support symlinks.)

    A HARDLINK is deliberately not judged here: a hardlink IS the regular
    file its name points at, indistinguishable at the per-file level, and a
    link count above one is routinely legitimate (``rsync --link-dest`` and
    ``cp -al`` backups). Nor is a planted second name deduplicated anywhere
    else — every key such a decision could use is attacker-controlled, so a
    dedupe would let a planted alias DISPLACE the real segment (see the scan
    comment in :meth:`SecurityEventLog._segments_oldest_first`). An alias's
    bounded worst case is repeating already-signed records.

    Returns a descriptor at position 0, ready for ``os.fdopen``; ownership
    passes to the caller. A refusal warns in the same "planted link?" style as
    the dirent filter, so the two layers read consistently in the log.

    scan of the live log, bounded by rotation's ``_SEGMENT_MAX_BYTES``, when

    gateway from becoming ready — audit degradation is survivable, a boot
    loop is not. On a failed warm the first later touch retries init on its

    Single source of truth shared by :class:`SecurityEventLog` (the key's
    creator/owner) and dependent protocols (``session_pid_sig``) so they can
    never diverge on which file anchors trust. Tracks the LIVE singleton's
    RESOLVED key path when one is initialized (tests and embedded deployments
    pass a ``base_dir``; a failed legacy migration keeps the legacy location —
    see ``_load_or_create_hmac_key``); otherwise falls back to the same
    ``trust/`` default the singleton would use. Dependent protocols must
    resolve the key through this accessor rather than re-deriving the path
    (e.g. via ``config_dir()``; ``_default_dir()`` honors ``KIROCREW_HOME`` the
    same way, so resolving through the shared accessor keeps the trust root
    single under isolated-home deployments).

    RE-RESOLVES per call. ``_hmac_key_file`` is decided once inside
    ``_load_or_create_hmac_key`` and a legacy install can leave it on the legacy
    location after a failed migration; a sibling process that later completes
    that migration deletes the file this process is still naming. Without
    re-resolution every dependent protocol inherits that dead path and has to
    grow its own recovery, which is one fallback per caller instead of the class
    being closed (the shape ``session_pid_sig`` would be left in).

    What re-resolution does NOT touch is the audit chain. The chain is signed
    and verified with ``self._hmac_key``, the BYTES read once at init, and no
    record carries a key id or generation marker — so re-reading the key file
    into the signing key mid-process would orphan every record already chained
    (which is why ``_load_or_create_hmac_key`` raises rather than regenerating,
    and why migration moves bytes with ``os.replace``). This accessor returns a
    PATH that the signing and verification code never reads. The anchor stays
    pinned to the bytes cached at init; only the path handed to dependent
    protocols follows the file.

    A relocated candidate is adopted ONLY when its bytes equal the key this
    process already validated at init. Adopting an unverified file would be a
    downgrade rather than a fix: the resolved path vanishing is exactly the
    moment an actor who can write the trust directory would plant a key of their
    own, and handing dependents a path is handing them signing material. When
    nothing verifies, the resolved path is returned unchanged so the operator
    report keeps naming the file that actually broke, and
    ``session_pid_sig._load_hmac_key`` still recovers from the in-memory copy.
