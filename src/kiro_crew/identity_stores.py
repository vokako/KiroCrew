"""The single canonical table of kiro-cli / amazon-q identity-store locations.

Resolving these stores per reader, each with its own hardcoded per-platform
list and no shared helper, drifts apart one reader at a time. This module is
the shared source of truth: an ordered table of
``(platform, home_relative_dir, product, trust)`` rows, plus the small set of
projections every reader needs. Every other reader is a thin wrapper over a
projection here, so a new location is added ONCE.

Two properties are enforced by the table's shape, not by scattered convention:

* **TRUSTED implies FENCED.** A store is trusted (``from_cli_store=True`` at the
  usage reader) only when an agent file tool cannot write it, and that fence is
  home-anchored at exactly these directories. So every row is fenced; the
  ``trust`` column only distinguishes kiro-cli's OWN credential (``TRUSTED``)
  from another product's readable-but-not-owned store (``OTHER``).
* **Ordering is preserved.** The projections emit rows in the table's order,
  which is the exact order the pre-refactor readers used
  (``.local/share`` -> ``Library/Application Support`` -> ``AppData/Local`` ->
  ``AppData/Roaming``). Golden tests freeze that order.

LEAF module: stdlib-only imports so any module (including ``security.py``, which
is imported very early) can depend on it without a cycle.
