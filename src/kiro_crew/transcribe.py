"""Speech-to-text for whole audio files: one local recogniser, two adapted ones.

The default provider is ``local``: the whisper.cpp recogniser that
:mod:`kiro_crew.stt` holds loaded in this process. Keeping the model resident is
what makes it usable, because the cost that made local speech-to-text feel broken
was never the decode. A warm decode of 4.2 s of audio measures 30-48 ms (real-time
factor 0.007-0.011) and a 0.9 s push-to-talk utterance 27 ms, against seconds per
utterance for anything that loads a model per recording. It needs no external
binary and it works on every OS Kiro Crew supports.

Two further providers are *adapted* onto the same seam rather than being
first-class, and neither may add a step to the local path:

- ``apple``: Apple's on-device SpeechAnalyzer (macOS 26+), which downloads no
  model because the OS ships the assets. Owned by :mod:`kiro_crew.apple_speech`.
- ``transcribe``: AWS Transcribe Streaming, a paid service, gated on the recorded
  operator consent in :mod:`kiro_crew.aws_consent`.

Compressed input still needs ffmpeg: a Slack voice memo arrives as ogg/Opus and
the dashboard records webm. Desktop releases carry a pinned imageio-ffmpeg wheel
with that executable, so desktop users never install a system binary separately;
source installs use a system FFmpeg from fixed platform paths, or the
digest-verified store :mod:`kiro_crew.stt.decoder` fetches the same pinned upstream
bytes into. A 16 kHz mono WAV and live PCM skip the executable entirely.

Two guards here are deliberately provider-independent, because a per-branch copy
is a copy that will be missing from the next branch someone adds:
:func:`_is_sensitive_audio_path` refuses before any provider is dispatched, and
:func:`_redact_transcript` runs on every provider's output.

    """Build the ordered directory list to probe for an ffmpeg install.

    Every entry is a PACKAGE MANAGER's directory. Whatever this resolves is exec'd by
    the gateway, so a generic user-writable directory must not appear at all: an
    earlier version carried ``~/ffmpeg`` and ``~/.local/bin`` for a user who had
    unzipped a static build by hand, and searching them LAST was not enough -- on a
    host with no packaged ffmpeg they were still trusted, and ``~/.local/bin`` is a
    generic dumping ground on nearly every PATH. Speculative support for a manual
    unzip is not worth a path that executes agent-written code as the gateway; a host
    without ffmpeg gets the "install ffmpeg or send 16 kHz mono WAV" log and a
    supported ``brew``/``apt`` install instead.

    Package prefixes are kept even where they are user-OWNED: Homebrew makes
    ``/opt/homebrew`` user-owned on Apple Silicon, and winget's user-scope target sits
    under ``%LOCALAPPDATA%``. The distinction is not the mode bits but whether the
    directory is a managed install root -- planting there means overwriting a package
    manager's own file, which is a different proposition from dropping a new name into
    a directory that exists to hold loose binaries. Dropping these would leave the
    feature unusable for most macOS and Windows users.

    Ordered most-trusted first regardless, and `_find_ffmpeg` consults
    `platform_compat.trusted_system_path` ahead of this list entirely.

    On Windows the two idiomatic install locations are the winget/Chocolatey

# Artifacts the macOS app signer REWRITES on its way into a release, so the
# upstream digest above cannot be the only anchor. Signing replaces the wheel's
# ad-hoc LC_CODE_SIGNATURE with a Developer ID one (plus hardened runtime and a
# secure timestamp), which changes both size and SHA-256, and it is not optional:
# Apple notarization rejects the whole submission over an unsigned nested
# executable -- including one hidden inside a compressed member, which the notary
# service decompresses and scans (submission 3dbd3c7d). A digest that could
# survive signing does not exist, because it is not known until after the signing
# service has run.
#
# So these artifacts are authenticated by EITHER anchor, both cryptographic:
#   - the pinned upstream digest -- a local/unsigned build, and the desktop build
#     gate, which executes the decoder BEFORE the bundle is signed; or
#   - a valid Developer ID signature from our own team on the exact bytes staged
#     for execution, which is what a released app carries.
# Neither anchor is a path or a filesystem-permission claim.
# BOTH macOS slices are here: build-desktop.sh ships the arm64 AND x86_64
# imageio-ffmpeg executables as plain Mach-O under Contents/Resources, and the app
# signer signs every nested binary with Developer ID + hardened runtime + secure
# timestamp (generate-manifest.py enumerates them). So the released Intel-Mac slice
# authenticates via its signature anchor exactly like the arm64 slice, its bytes
# having been rewritten by signing away from the pinned upstream digest.
#
# The set is therefore exactly the macos-* members of _SHIPPED_FFMPEG_PLATFORMS, and

    closing the handle here (which removes the staged directory) makes the

    WAV files are answered exactly from the header. Everything else is answered
    by the same decoder that will transcribe it: a null decode bounded at
    ``max_secs`` plus one second (``-t``), reading the decoded timestamp from
    ffmpeg's ``-progress`` stream. Decoding — not metadata — is deliberate: the
    dashboard's own recordings are MediaRecorder webm, whose header carries no
    duration at all, so a metadata probe would answer None for exactly the files
    users are most likely to import. The ``-t`` bound keeps the probe's cost
    proportional to the cap, not to the file.

    A None is honest, not fail-open in disguise, ONLY while the caller gives the
    probe at least the timeout the transcode itself will get (callers with an
    ``stt_config`` in hand pass ``stt_config.timeout_secs``; the default matches
    the config default). The probe decodes at most ``max_secs + 1`` seconds — a
    strict subset of the transcode's work — so under an aligned budget every
    None cause leads to a loud downstream failure: an undecodable file fails the
    transcode the same way, and a host slow enough to time the probe out times
    the strictly-larger transcode out too. A SHORTER probe budget would reopen
    the gap where the probe gives up but the transcode "succeeds" truncated —
    silent data loss on exactly the over-cap files this guard exists to catch.
