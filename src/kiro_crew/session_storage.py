"""Measure the disk a session costs, and reclaim it under user control.

A session is presented as ONE thing with ONE size, because that is what it is to
the person looking at it. Underneath, its bytes are split across two stores that
Kiro Crew and kiro-cli each own:

* ``<data home>/sessions/<stem>.jsonl`` plus its rotated
  ``sessions/archive/<stem>__<stamp>.jsonl`` segments — the transcript, read by
  dashboard history, search and memory consolidation.
* ``<kiro home>/sessions/cli/<sid>.json`` + ``<sid>.jsonl`` — kiro-cli's replay
  log, read to resume the session.

That split is an implementation detail and never surfaces in a report: callers get
one total and one session count.

The split does, however, dictate the deletion rule. **A session's halves are
always reclaimed together.** Removing only one leaves a broken session rather than
a freed one: drop the replay log and the transcript still lists a session that can
no longer resume; drop the transcript and a resumable session has no history or
search. Either way the user is left with something worse than both extremes.
:func:`_unit_paths` is therefore the single place that answers "what files is this
session made of", and every move, restore and delete goes through it.

Not every session has both halves, and that is normal rather than an error — a
subagent run leaves only a replay log, and a session whose mapping was pruned
leaves only a transcript. The rule is that whatever halves exist move together.

Reclaiming moves files into ``<data home>/trash/sessions/<batch>/`` rather than
unlinking them. On a default install both stores sit under ``~/.kiro``, so the
move is a same-filesystem :func:`os.rename`: instant regardless of size, and
instantly reversible. Space is **not** returned to the filesystem until the trash
is emptied; :attr:`StorageReport.trash_bytes` exists so callers can say so plainly
instead of reporting a reclaim that leaves ``df`` unchanged.

Every batch carries an append-only manifest recording each file's original
absolute path, so a restore puts files back where they came from instead of
inferring it from the layout. A batch can span six figures of sessions, so a
whole-document manifest rewritten per move would cost quadratic bytes; appending
also leaves a partial batch fully restorable after an interruption.

Reading is cached; reclaiming never is
--------------------------------------
Enumerating the stores is the entire cost of a read here — half a million replay
files on the measured machine — so a pass is kept briefly and shared between the
row list, the totals and each row's detail. Only the FILESYSTEM halves are
cached — the store scan and, on read paths, the co-tenant pass beside it: the
flags derived from the caller's index are recomputed every call, every
refusal-deriving path runs uncached, and every mutation re-enumerates and
re-reads the index inside the lock. So no refusal is ever answered from a
snapshot, and a stale cache can only make the report slightly old, never make a
reclaim take something it should not.

Sessions this instance does not own
-----------------------------------
The replay store can be shared. A pod now gets its own (``pod/runtime.py`` exports
``KIRO_HOME`` inside the pod home), so a current pod is not a co-tenant — but a
directory left by a pod from before that export may still own sessions in the
machine-wide store. Those maps are files at a known host-side path, so
:func:`cotenant_sids` reads them and protects the sessions they name individually,
exactly like this instance's own. A blanket refusal is kept only where ownership
genuinely cannot be established: a co-tenant whose map is unreadable, or a data
home isolated from the store it reads (see :func:`reclaim_block_reason`).

#   dashboard's trash pre-classification — runs uncached, so no refusal is ever
#   decided from a snapshot. The one cached contribution to ``active`` (the
#   co-tenant set) therefore only ever staleness-affects what a read displays.
# * Only READ paths opt in. A reclaim re-enumerates, and additionally re-reads
#   the index inside the mutation lock, so the selection it acts on is current.

    instance's own mapped sessions. *refusals* names the instances that make a
    reclaim unsafe at all, as ``(instance, why)`` — the cases per-session
    protection cannot cover.

    A co-tenant's mapping is not a mystery: it is a file at a known host-side
    path, and reading it turns "some other instance may still want these" into the
    specific list of sessions it wants. The blanket refusal this replaces keyed on
    a pod DIRECTORY existing, which was wrong twice over on a machine that has run
    pods — a current pod keeps its own replay store and so cannot be harmed by a
    reclaim here at all, and a torn-down pod's leftover directory owns nothing.

    Three outcomes, because they need different treatment:

    * **Its own replay store** (``<pod home>/kiro`` exists). It cannot own anything
      in this store, so its sids are recorded but it constrains nothing. This is
      what a pod provisioned by current code looks like.
    * **No own store but a map naming sids** — a genuine shared-store instance.
      Per-session protection is NOT enough for these: they can seed and resume a
      session at any moment, including part-way through a move loop that runs for
      six figures of sessions, so the snapshot this function returns can go stale
      mid-move. Those force a refusal.
    * **Unreadable or malformed map.** Ownership cannot be established, so also a
      refusal.

    A co-tenant with no session map has mapped nothing and protects nothing; that
    is an ordinary state (a pod torn down mid-provision leaves its audit log and
    little else), not a failure to read.

    Liveness is deliberately not the test anywhere here. A stopped instance's map
    still names sessions it would resume if restarted, so ownership — not whether a
    process is running this second — is what protects them.

    *cached* permits a recent pass over the pod maps to be reused, mirroring
    :func:`_scan_raw`'s flag: opt-in per call site, never global. It exists for

    :func:`move_to_trash` (and :func:`reclaim_block_reason`'s default) must
    never opt in — a stale answer there could let a reclaim proceed against a

    home reading the machine-wide store cannot see the default instance's
    mappings, so a resumable conversation reads as retired and could be staged and
    then emptied out from under a gateway this process cannot see.

    Decided on RESOLVED paths, never on whether the environment variables are set,
    and by requiring the store to be CONTAINED in this instance's data home rather
    than by testing it against the default location. Both overrides are validated
    and silently fall back to the default when they name an unsafe target, so
    ``KIRO_HOME=/etc`` alongside an isolated ``KIROCREW_HOME`` leaves this process
    reading the shared store while an env-presence test would report it isolated —
    the exact hazard, reached through a rejected override. Containment also covers
    a store that is shared without being the default one: two isolated instances
    pointed at the same custom ``KIRO_HOME`` see neither the default store nor each
    other's maps.

    The freshness floor narrows the window but does not close it — a session idle
    for a day is still resumable — so the operation is refused rather than
    attempted. Isolating both homes together, or neither, is safe.

    Pods are handled per session rather than per instance, because their mappings
    ARE discoverable: see :func:`cotenant_sids`. Only a pod whose map cannot be
    read still costs the whole instance its ability to reclaim.

    One code path for both of :func:`_move_file_exclusive`'s branches, because they have
    the same shape and the same hazard: a hard link and a copy both leave TWO directory
    entries for one file, and removing the source is a SECOND metadata operation. Unlike
    a same-filesystem rename — one atomic operation, where forcing the destination side
    forces the removal with it — nothing orders these two for us. If the unlink reaches
    disk and the new name does not, the inode has no name left at all and the session is
    gone, which is why the destination is synced BEFORE the source is dropped rather than
    alongside it.

    A failing destination sync ATTEMPTS to withdraw *dst* — the unlink is suppressed so
    that it cannot displace the sync error, which is the one that says what went wrong.
    That withdrawal is safe because the SOURCE has not been touched at that point, so
    removing *dst* provably restores the state the call started in. The unlink below is
    different: once it has been attempted, no observation available here proves whether
    the original survived, so nothing is withdrawn there. This function's callers read an

    but a recoverable one, and it is chosen over withdrawing a copy that may be the last
    one. Only the calling move created *dst*, so keeping it costs nothing that predates
    the call either.

    The source-side sync is ``best_effort`` and runs after the unlink, where nothing may
    raise: the move is complete by then, so an exception could only mislabel finished work

    the manifest nothing in the batch is accounted for.

    There is deliberately NO exemption for the incoming name
    :func:`_copy_across_filesystems` writes, even though a crash can leave one here and
    a caller then cannot empty the batch until an operator removes it. A name is not
    proof of who wrote it: everything else in this module's threat model assumes a
    batch can be planted in (a linked manifest, a file substituted at the manifest's
    name), so anything that may rename a file inside a batch could pick that prefix and
    have this scan pass over a staged file the manifest never approved for deletion.
    Blocking a deletion that should proceed is recoverable; letting one through is not.

    A scan that cannot be completed RAISES rather than returning a short list. This
    function exists to block deletions, so an empty result must mean "there is
    nothing unaccounted for", never "the walk gave up early" — ``rglob`` skips
    unreadable directories silently, which would turn a transient error into
    permission to delete a file that is the only copy of a session.

    """Re-ask "is this the batch, and does it hold anything unlisted" of a DESCRIPTOR.

    The trash-specific half of :func:`_remove_emptied_batch`, passed to ``pinned_fs`` as its
    approval hook. Both questions were already answered by path before the removal was
    reached - which is exactly the answer that cannot be relied on, because resolving the
    batch's parent FOLLOWS an ancestor that is already a symbolic link. Pinning the walk
    then reaches the link's target faithfully, and the removal would empty that.

    So the two questions are asked again here, of the descriptor the removal will actually
    address, from ONE read of ONE file:

    * the pinned root must BE the directory the caller was looking at, compared by
      ``(st_dev, st_ino)`` against an identity the caller captured before its own by-path
      read - at the batch's creation on one path, before the leftover scan on the other.
      This is the check that makes the rest sound. Without it the only thing standing
      between a swapped ancestor and a deletion is whether the directory the link points at
      can produce a convincing manifest, and a tree an actor can write to can: they plant a
      header naming this batch and a listing covering its contents, and every other question
      here answers yes about the wrong directory. An inode cannot be forged by writing files.
    * the manifest is opened through ``root_fd``, its inode is checked on the OPEN handle
      against the one the scan recorded, and its header must claim THIS batch's
      directory name. The header is the link back to the caller's own selection: a directory
      substituted for the batch brings its own contents, and a directory that is not a
      trash batch at all brings none - neither can produce a header naming this name.
      :func:`_header_names_this_batch` is the same check the approval on the delete path
      makes, for the same reason.
    * NOTHING but the manifest may remain. Not "nothing unlisted" - nothing at all. Both
      callers reach here only when the batch should already be empty of files: the restore
      path has MOVED every listed file back out, and the staging path has a manifest with no
      entries at all. So a file at a listed path is not the listed file; it is something that
      arrived at that name afterwards, and it may be the only copy of whatever it is.
      Consulting the listing here would authorise deleting exactly that, on the strength of a
      name the manifest happens to mention. The stricter rule also needs no listing, which is
      why the entries this read produced are discarded.

    ONE read, not two, and that is the load-bearing part rather than an efficiency note.
    Asking :func:`_summarize_manifest` for the header and :func:`_manifest_rels` for a listing
    opens the file TWICE, and a manifest replaced in between passes the header check on the
    first file while the second answers for another. The header now comes from one handle
    whose inode was verified on that same handle, so there is no interval for a replacement to
    land in.

    Returns None to allow the removal, or a reason code to withhold it. The identity
    comparison against the caller's recorded inode happens BEFORE this, in
    :func:`_remove_emptied_batch`'s own hook -- it owns that answer because the caller also
    needs to know whether the path was verified, and a reason code cannot carry that.

    Links are refused too, not exempted. A symbolic link holds no data of its own, which is
    why the delete path removes scanned ones - but it is also the only entry a removal can
    take by NAME, with a scanned-inode check and an unlink that are two separate syscalls.
    Admitting one is admitting that window, so a batch holding a link is kept and left for
    `empty_trash`, which removes links through its own approval when a user asks for the
    empty.

    What is left is the removal, and ``shutil.rmtree(batch)`` would take a PATH, which
    the kernel re-resolves component by component. The trash root and the directories above
    it are writable by the same user, which in this product includes an agent, so one of
    them swapped to a symbolic link after the caller's own read is followed and the removal
    lands wherever the link points. Neither caller holds the mutation lock across that
    window, and the checks above them are all by path, so nothing else closed it.

    :func:`kiro_crew.pinned_fs.remove_tree_pinned` is the same mechanism the delete path
    uses, reached through the same module rather than respelled here: the parent chain is
    pinned one ``openat`` per component, the batch is opened through it with
    ``O_NOFOLLOW``, and every removal inside addresses a descriptor whose inode a scan
    already recorded.

    Pinning is only half of it, and the weaker half. It closes the window after the path is
    resolved; the swap that lands BEFORE the resolve is followed by ``Path.resolve()``
    itself, and the pinned walk then reaches the wrong tree correctly - faithfully pinned to
    a directory that is not this batch. What closes that is
    :func:`_approve_emptied_batch`, which compares the pinned root against *expect* - an
    identity the CALLER captured before its own by-path read - and then re-asks through the
    same descriptor the two questions the callers asked by path.

    :func:`list_trash` omits, which puts those files out of reach of restore AND of
    empty. That is the loss this whole layer exists to prevent, arrived at by
    reporting success too early.

    Order matters. The manifest's CONTENT first, because it is what makes the moves
    reversible; then the directories that hold the staged names, deepest first, so a
    child's entries are durable before the entry naming that child is.

    the only copy. Each caller decides what to do with it; nothing is swallowed here.

    *source_dirs* — the live-store directories the batch drained — are the exception,
    on both counts. They are synced ONCE here rather than per file, because the
    same-filesystem path is a bare ``os.rename`` and a sync per staged file is exactly
    the cost that would stop a trash working at tens of gigabytes; and they are synced
    ``best_effort`` because a source entry that is not yet durable can only resurrect
    a name whose staged copy is intact — a duplicate the user thought they reclaimed,
    never a lost session. Raising for that after the batch is fully recorded would
    report a completed move as failed.

    This does not make a crash MID-move consistent — a batch interrupted halfway

    A manifest is a file on disk: a tampered or corrupted one can name an absolute
    path or walk out with ``..``. Every consumer of a manifest entry goes through
    here first, so "is this name usable" is answered in ONE place rather than at each
    call site - the size read below skipped this check when it was written inline in
    the delete, and stat'd whatever the manifest said.

    Absoluteness is asked of the PATH rather than of any spelling of a separator.
    Enumerating those was the earlier bug: ``PurePosixPath("//tmp/victim").parts`` is
    ``("//", "tmp", "victim")`` - a POSIX root of two slashes, which a check against
    ``"/"`` misses - and an absolute path passed to ``os.open`` ignores ``dir_fd``
    entirely, so the open leaves the batch. Both flavours are consulted because the
    coarse path joins these names with the local ``Path``: on Windows ``..\\x`` is a
    parent reference and ``C:\\x`` is absolute, neither of which POSIX parsing sees.

    A DRIVE is rejected whether or not the path is absolute, which is not the same
    question. ``C:.ssh/id_rsa`` is drive-RELATIVE - ``is_absolute()`` is False - yet
    joining it onto the batch on Windows replaces the anchor, because pathlib lets a
    right-hand side that carries a drive take over, and it then resolves against that
    drive's working directory. So the size read would stat a path outside the batch and
    report its existence and size. Asking for ``.drive`` covers every spelling of that,
    including ``c:y``, which a check for a component ending in a colon does not see.

    That also refuses a POSIX file legitimately named ``a:b``, since Windows parsing
    reads the same two characters as a drive. Accepted deliberately: this store names
    its own files, so nothing it writes looks like that, and the cost of being wrong is
    one batch reported incomplete and kept rather than a path escaping the batch.

    An embedded NUL is refused with no such trade, because no file name can contain one:
    a JSON manifest CAN carry it (``"\\u0000"``), and every ``os`` call then raises
    ``ValueError``, which is not ``OSError`` and so was not caught where a bad name is
    meant to be skipped - it escaped mid-loop and left the batch half-deleted.

    verification was recursed into and its links and empty directories removed, because
    discovery cannot tell an approved directory from a substituted one.

    Driven by the APPROVED map instead, so there is nothing to discover. Each parent is
    reached through :func:`_open_chain`, which admits a component only as the inode the
    approval recorded, and the removal is ``rmdir`` relative to that descriptor - so a
    directory the approval never named is not opened, not descended into, and not removed.

    Deepest first, by component count, because ``rmdir`` needs a directory to be empty and
    a parent cannot go before its children. Iterative for the same reason the scan is: a
    deep tree must not raise ``RecursionError``.

    The removal itself goes through a rename to an unguessable name, because ``rmdir``
    addresses a NAME and so does the check above it: an actor with write access to the
    parent could swap the name between the two and have an unapproved directory removed on
    another one's approval. That mechanism is
    :func:`kiro_crew.pinned_fs.remove_dir_verified`, which is where the batch directory and

    there and the caller must say so: reporting bytes alone left a batch that survived
    looking exactly like an empty one - "0 bytes freed, success" - which is the silent
    refusal this module's skip codes exist to remove. The two ways that happens are the
    batch not opening at all, and the tree not being gone afterwards.

    Driven by the MANIFEST, not by a directory walk, and that is a safety property
    rather than a convenience. A walk has to decide per directory entry whether to
    descend, and on Windows a junction is not a symlink - ``os.path.islink`` reports
    False for one - so ``os.walk`` descends into it and would unlink the files it
    points at, outside the trash entirely. Naming the files means nothing is ever
    discovered by traversal.

    Each file is then removed by ``(directory fd, name)``, with every directory
    component opened ``O_NOFOLLOW`` from the batch down. That is what makes the
    per-file delete safe rather than merely validated: checking a path and then
    unlinking it re-resolves the prefix, so a component swapped to a link in between is
    followed and the same-named file outside the trash deleted. Nothing here resolves a
    path at unlink time, so there is no window to win.

    Removing the emptied directories is by descriptor too, bottom-up, so no step of
    this path ever resolves a path - not even the last one. Finishing with
    ``rmtree(batch)`` re-resolved the whole prefix, which reopened the batch through
    exactly the ancestors the walk above exists to pin. Callers reach here only after
    :func:`_unlisted_files` has confirmed the batch holds nothing the manifest omits,
    so "every listed file" is every file.

    Progress is per file rather than per batch because that is the point of naming the
    files: the store this exists for stages a single batch holding tens of thousands of
    sessions, where "one batch done" is one step from nothing to finished, minutes
    later. Where the platform can neither open a directory refusing to follow a link
    nor delete relative to one - Windows has neither - the coarse ``rmtree`` is taken
    instead, with the bytes measured after the attempt and the survivors subtracted,
    and progress degrades to one report per batch. A smoother bar is not worth a weaker
    delete.

    ``base_bytes`` is what earlier batches in the same call already freed, so the
    number handed to ``on_progress`` is always the total for the whole operation and
    never a figure that restarts per batch.
