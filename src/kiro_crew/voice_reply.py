"""Kiro Crew voice reply — generate TTS audio and deliver it to the requesting surface.

Post-response hook: strips markdown, generates audio via the configured
TTS provider (Amazon Polly or local Piper), then delivers it back to the
requesting surface (Slack thread upload, dashboard playback).
Fire-and-forget — never blocks the text response.

Supported providers:
- ``system`` (default): the host's own speech engine, which needs nothing
  installed and no account — ``say`` on macOS, System.Speech through
  Windows PowerShell 5.1 on Windows, ``espeak-ng`` on Linux when present.
  Produces WAV. Linux is the one platform where it can be absent.
- ``polly``: OPTIONAL Amazon Polly via the ``aws polly synthesize-speech`` CLI.
  Produces MP3. Requires the ``aws`` CLI on PATH plus valid AWS credentials +
  network. This module never imports ``boto3``/``botocore`` — Polly is driven
  entirely through the CLI subprocess, so the module imports cleanly on a
  vanilla machine without any AWS SDK installed. When the CLI or credentials
  are absent, the Polly path degrades gracefully (returns ``None``).
- ``piper``: Local neural TTS via the ``piper`` CLI
  (https://github.com/OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl, published as the ``piper-tts``
  wheel). Produces WAV. Requires the ``piper`` binary and a voice model
  (.onnx + .onnx.json) on disk. Fully offline, and the best offline quality.
