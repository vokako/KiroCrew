"""One-time merge of orphaned dashboard copies back into channel transcripts.

A conversation started on a messaging channel persists under a channel session
key (``slack:<thread_ts>``), whose transcript file is ``slack_<thread_ts>.jsonl``.
Its dashboard tab now shares that one file. Earlier the tab owned a SEPARATE
transcript at ``dashboard_slack_<thread_ts>.jsonl``, seeded as a copy — so an
existing install can hold a leftover file of that shape, and any turn the user
typed in the tab lives ONLY there. Those are real user messages, so the leftover
cannot simply be deleted.

This module merges such a file into the channel transcript and then removes it.
Two states exist on an upgraded install:

* **One file** (``slack_<ts>.jsonl`` alone) -- the common case: the tab was
  surfaced but never written to, so there is nothing to migrate.
* **Two files** -- the user typed in the tab, or closed it. The extra file holds
  turns that exist nowhere else.

Design:

* **Loss-safe ordering.** The merged transcript is written first (atomically, via
  temp file + ``os.replace``); the leftover is deleted only after that write
  returns. Any failure leaves BOTH files exactly as they were, so the worst
  outcome is "the leftover is still there", never "messages are gone".
* **Idempotent.** A successful pass leaves one file, so the next pass finds
  nothing. A pass that merged but failed to delete re-merges to a byte-identical
  result (every message is already present, so de-duplication drops all of them)
  and retries the delete. Safe to run on every startup.
* **Merged by timestamp.** Both files' messages are ordered on their ``ts``
  field, with the channel side winning ties, so a reader sees one chronological
  conversation rather than two concatenated halves.
* **Precise identification.** A candidate must have a ``dashboard_`` prefix whose
  remainder is a channel session key stem (per
  :func:`~kiro_crew.messaging.link.is_channel_session_key`) AND that channel
  transcript must already exist. A dashboard-born session is therefore never
  touched: its name is ``chat-<N>-<ts>``, which is not a channel key, and it has
  no channel transcript to merge into.
* **The channel file's metadata line survives.** It carries the binding that
  makes the tab the conversation; letting the leftover's metadata overwrite it
  would break that. Only genuinely user-owned presentation fields are carried
  over, and only where the channel side has none (see :data:`_CARRIED_META_FIELDS`).
