"""Auto-nudge service — reactive same-session self-prompting loop.

Each active loop is bound to a dashboard chat slot. When the slot's turn
completes (``HOOK_EVENT_STOP``), we arm a timer toward the loop's persistent
deadline (``next_due_ts``). If the deadline elapses with no new user input,
we inject the configured nudge message as the next turn into the same slot.

The countdown is DEADLINE-PRESERVING: a user message cancels the pending fire
(a nudge must never race a human turn) but does not push the deadline back —
when the user's turn ends, the timer resumes toward the same ``next_due_ts``,
firing shortly after the turn if the deadline already passed. Only the loop's
own delivered cycles start a fresh full interval (measured from the nudge
turn's end). Without this, a session chatted in more often than ``idle_secs``
starves its loop forever: every message restarted the full interval, so a
30-minute babysit loop in an active conversation never fired at all.

State is persisted to ``~/.kiro/crew/autonudge.json`` (fcntl-locked, atomic
write). On gateway restart, active loops are reloaded and timers re-armed.

The browser observes the loop through the normal chat stream path — nudges
appear as user-style messages tagged ``[auto-nudge cycle N]`` so they are
visually distinct from human input.

Feature-flagged via env ``KIROCREW_AUTONUDGE`` (on by default; set to ``0`` to disable).

# Namespaced session-key prefixes that identify messaging-channel sessions
# (as opposed to bare dashboard chat-slot keys). Channel-bound loops have no
# dashboard turn-lifecycle hooks (notify_turn_complete / notify_user_input),
# so they run on a fixed interval instead of an idle timer: the timer re-arms
# itself right after every delivered fire.
#
# This mirrors ``messaging.link.CHANNEL_SESSION_NAMESPACES``, spelled out here
# rather than derived from it, for two independent reasons:
#
# 1. IMPORT WEIGHT. ``autonudge`` is imported at module scope by ``mcp_core``
#    (i.e. by every MCP server process) and by the dashboard chat layer, and it
#    depends only on config/security/platform_compat today. Naming
#    ``kiro_crew.messaging.link`` runs ``messaging/__init__``, which pulls the
#    driver/renderer/transport layer and, transitively, the ACP client, agent,
#    hooks, artifacts, metrics and sqlite — measured at 48 additional
#    ``kiro_crew`` modules to obtain one tuple of string literals.
# 2. THIS IS A KEY-SHAPE QUESTION, NOT A LIVE-CAPABILITY ONE. ``is_channel_key``
#    selects the RE-ARM STRATEGY and the expiry-notification metadata, so it has
#    to answer identically whether or not the transport happens to be registered
#    at this instant. Deriving it from a runtime ``supports_proactive_send``
#    lookup fails toward the WRONG branch: a loop whose transport is momentarily
#    absent would read as a dashboard slot, so ``_run_fire_cycle`` would stop
#    self-re-arming it — and nothing else ever will, since
#    ``notify_turn_complete`` never fires for a channel key — while the expiry
#    notice would synthesize a ``dashboard:<namespace>:<id>`` jump link pointing
#    at no slot.
#
# Membership therefore does NOT assert deliverability; it asserts "this key names
# a conversation rather than a chat slot". Whether a nudge can actually be
# delivered stays with the fail-closed ladder in ``dashboard/chat_runner.py``
# (``_resolve_channel_target``: governance, then a REGISTERED transport, then
# ``supports_proactive_send``), which logs its reason and degrades to a no-op.
# So a namespace is listed even when nothing can currently be delivered to it,
# and the two clearest cases are both here: ``whatsapp`` has no transport package
# in this fork at all, and ``feishu`` ships one that declares
# ``supports_proactive_send=False`` (its renderer only replies to an inbound
# message id, so a nudge cycle has nowhere to put the answer). Both still classify
# as channel keys, because the alternative is worse than a refusal: an unlisted key
# is read as a dashboard slot and silently stops being re-armed, whereas a listed
# one reaches the ladder and is refused with a logged reason. Being listed is
# likewise not an arming permission — that is ``binding_key_for``, which is
# narrower still and gated on an ownership check and a fire route.

    """Re-home a persisted ``stop_sentinel_path`` onto the CURRENT data home.

    The kill-switch path is resolved once at arm time (``resolve_stop_sentinel``,
    which builds it under ``workspace_dir_for(...)`` → normally
    ``config_dir()/workspace``) and then persisted verbatim in the loop store.
    That store survives the one-time ``~/.kirocrew`` → ``~/.kiro/crew`` data-home
    migration (``config/paths.py``) and is re-armed on the next ``start()``, so a
    loop armed BEFORE the move comes back pointing at a directory that no longer
    exists. ``_timer`` only ever tests ``Path(stop_sentinel_path).exists()``, so
    such a loop has a DEAD kill switch: a sentinel written at the freshly
    resolved (current-home) path is never seen, and the only remaining stops are
    ``max_cycles`` and an explicit remove.

    Three transformations, in order:

    1. **Pass through a path already under the CURRENT home.** Checked FIRST,
       because ``KIROCREW_HOME`` may legally point *inside* the legacy root
       (e.g. ``~/.kirocrew/dev``). Such a path is lexically under
       ``~/.kirocrew`` yet already live and correct; re-homing it would produce
       ``~/.kirocrew/dev/dev/workspace/…``, persist that, and — since the
       rewrite is not idempotent — append another segment every boot, disabling
       a WORKING kill switch with the very code meant to repair dead ones.
    2. **Re-home a STRANDED legacy-rooted path.** A path under ``~/.kirocrew``
       is rewritten onto the resolved current home. The migration relocated the
       whole tree wholesale, so the tail after the home prefix is still correct.
       Gated on the sentinel's directory no longer existing: an absolute
       ``workspaces.<name>.dir`` may legitimately live inside that tree (and the
       legacy root can survive as debris), and rewriting a live path would move
       a working kill switch outside its configured workspace and persist that.
       Skipped when the current home IS the legacy home (``KIROCREW_HOME``
       pointing there, or the migration's fall-back-to-legacy path) — there the
       persisted path is already live. Both sides are normalized LEXICALLY
       (``os.path.normpath``, no filesystem access) before the containment
       test, so an unnormalized value like ``~/.kirocrew/../workspace/STOP``
       is not mistaken for a legacy-contained path and rewritten elsewhere.
    3. **Re-apply the arm-time sensitivity refusal.** ``authorize_and_add_nudge``
       refuses a sensitive ``stop_sentinel_path`` at arm time, but the denylist
       can widen between releases and the persisted value outlives the original
       check. A path that is sensitive NOW is dropped to ``""`` (no sentinel)
       rather than kept, so the service never stats an attacker- or
       credential-adjacent location on a timer. The check itself FAILS CLOSED:
       if ``is_sensitive_path`` raises, the path is dropped rather than trusted,
       because an unvalidated path is exactly what this step exists to reject.

    Returns the (possibly rewritten) path, or ``""`` to mean "no sentinel".
    Non-``str`` input (a malformed store where ``stop_sentinel_path`` is a
    number or list) yields ``""`` instead of raising — this runs inside
    ``_load()`` during ``start()``, so an exception here would abort gateway
    startup entirely.

    Deliberately does NOT require the path to live under the data home: an
    absolute ``workspaces.<name>.dir`` is a legitimate configuration, and
    clearing those would break working kill switches.

    BLOCKING: performs no filesystem I/O itself, but ``is_sensitive_path``
    resolves realpaths, which can block on an unavailable network mount.
    ``start()`` therefore runs the whole load+repair phase in an executor.

    #: explicit boolean true gates. An absent key is a loop nobody chose to gate,
    #: usually a generic goal loop that predates the feature; a corrupt value is not
    #: a decision either. Being wrong in this direction costs a turn per interval,
    #: which is what today already costs. Being wrong the other way stops a
    #: recurring task because its instruction happened to mention a pull request.
    #:
    #: Persisted because the opt-out has to SURVIVE. The instruction is the target,

        pending fire without pushing the schedule back. An unset deadline (0 —
        a just-delivered fire, a legacy store entry) starts a fresh full
        countdown from now, and the assignment is persisted through a
        supervised background write so a restart resumes this countdown
        rather than restarting the interval. A deadline still in the future
        resumes with exactly the remaining time; only one already in the past
        fires after a short beat (``_OVERDUE_REARM_SECS``) rather than
        instantly, so a user mid-conversation keeps deferring it simply by
        sending another message. The delay is capped at ``idle_secs`` so a
        clock jump can never park the timer beyond one full interval.

        A monitor loop arms through this same path and on the same deadline. Its
        cadence is the interval the user already set, not a second clock on the

        agreed, and the one the user can see is the one they set. What differs
        for a monitor is not WHEN the timer wakes but what the wake costs -- the
        probe gate in :meth:`_timer` decides whether that tick spends a turn.

        ONE monitor is refused a timer outright: a record whose ``version`` this
        gateway does not implement. Such a record belongs to a newer gateway
        (a downgrade or a rollback read its store), and this controller cannot
        interpret its policy -- so arming it would run the loop under a policy
        nobody here understands, which for the pre-gate code path means
        injecting the raw message every interval with no decision at all. The
        refusal is deliberately made HERE, on the arm, rather than by rewriting
        the record: the stored ``active`` intent belongs to the gateway that
        wrote it and must survive the downgrade so an upgrade resumes the watch.

        A dashboard-bound loop has exactly one re-arm path after a delivered
        fire: ``notify_turn_complete``, called by the gateway after the slot's
        stop hook. If that hook never arrives -- the nudge turn errors, times
        out or is cancelled on a path that skips it, or the deferred re-arm was
        dropped by ``notify_user_input`` during the fire window -- the loop is
        left persisted ``active=true`` with a finished (or missing) timer task
        and nothing on a timer ever revives it. The only rescues used to be a
        gateway restart or a genuine turn completing in that exact slot. This
        task is the general backstop: it re-arms toward the loop's own
        persisted deadline, so a rescue never fires earlier than the schedule
        the user set (``_arm_from_deadline`` self-heals a cleared deadline into
        a fresh full countdown).

        The wait is scheduled through ``loop.call_later`` rather than
        ``asyncio.sleep`` on purpose: this file's own test suite (and any
        similar consumer) routinely patches module-level ``asyncio.sleep`` to
        a no-op to fast-forward the per-loop timers, and under that patch a
        sleep-based periodic task degrades into a busy loop that re-arms and
        re-fires everything continuously. A watchdog's cadence must stay on
        the wall clock regardless of how the timers it watches are driven.

        """One reconciler pass: rescue active loops stranded with no live timer.

        "No live timer" means the ``_timers`` entry is absent OR its task has
        finished. The finished-task form matters: nothing pops a timer task
        from ``_timers`` when it completes normally, so the stranded states
        this backstop exists for (a delivered fire whose stop hook never came,
        a timer task killed by an exception) leave a DONE task behind rather
        than an empty slot -- a membership test alone would miss every one of
        them. The absent form covers a loop whose pending timer was cancelled
        by ``notify_user_input`` and whose ``notify_turn_complete`` then never
        arrived because the slot's turn died on a hook-skipping path.

        A loop is re-armed only after TWO CONSECUTIVE passes observe it
        eligible-and-unarmed, because one observation cannot tell "stranded"
        apart from two live states that look identical for a while:

        * A slot whose user turn is still running. ``notify_user_input``
          cancelled the timer on purpose, and ``notify_turn_complete`` will
          re-arm when the turn ends. The turn-start hook also clears this
          loop's candidacy (see ``notify_user_input``), so a session showing
          any sign of life defers its rescue by a full two intervals. A turn
          that outlives BOTH intervals is re-armed anyway -- one observation
          window has to end somewhere, and the fire path's busy-slot refusal
          (plus its backoff) keeps a rescue that guessed wrong from ever
          delivering into the running turn; the wasted attempt is the cost of
          rescuing the turn that died silently, which looks identical from
          here.
        * A loop inside another coroutine's mutation window. ``update()``
          mutates fields, awaits an offloaded store write, and ROLLS BACK the
          fields if the write fails -- a single-pass reconciler could arm the
          transiently-active shape and leave a rolled-back inactive loop with
          a live timer. Two passes shrink that window, but the write has no
          timeout, so the guard that CLOSES it is the lock check below: every
          mutation runs inside ``self._lock``, this pass is synchronous, and
          a pass that finds the lock held defers entirely.

        Deliberately never touched, whatever the passes observe:

        * A loop mid-fire (``_firing``): its running task must never be
          cancelled (see ``update``), and ``_arm_timer`` cancels before it
          creates. The fire window owns its own re-arm bookkeeping.
        * A loop quiesced by administrative cleanup: cleanup owns it.
        * A monitor record whose version this gateway does not implement:
          ``_arm_from_deadline`` refuses those with an INFO line, and letting
          the reconciler retry it would repeat that line every pass forever.
        * A monitor whose wake claim is in flight with NO completion-evidence
          deadline -- EXCEPT a ``BUSY`` retry. The no-deadline shape is a
          claim that died mid-handoff: ``_load`` retires it on restart, and
          arming it here would wake a controller that answers ``NO_CHANGE``
          forever (the probe path is never reached, so no budget or cap can
          end it) -- an unretirable zombie dressed as a rescue. A ``BUSY``
          delivery is the one no-deadline shape that is legitimately LIVE:
          it proves no action turn started, and ``_load`` resumes it at its
          persisted retry deadline, so this pass must too. A claim WITH a
          deadline is safe: its ``next_due_ts`` is that deadline, and the
          armed tick either finds evidence or retires the claim through
          ``record_monitor_completion_evidence_unavailable``.

            # the loop still active, and a retarget landing between them let an old
            # verdict deactivate a subject that had never been observed.

            # than merely deferred.

        only a fresh terminal that CARRIES THE SAME CLASSIFICATION returns True, so an

        Returns ``(loop, "", 200)`` once the cycle is armed to run, or
        ``(None, reason, status)`` on refusal — the ``(obj, error, status)``
        shape the authz chokepoints in :mod:`kiro_crew.autonudge_authz` already
        use, so the HTTP handler stays a thin mapping.

        WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: it does not deliver the nudge
        itself. It re-arms through :meth:`_arm_timer`, so the cycle runs inside
        the ordinary :meth:`_timer` body — the stop sentinel, the cycle cap, the
        wall-clock budget, the approval-stall stop and the probe gate all apply
        exactly as they do on a scheduled tick, and the delivery goes through the
        one ``_on_fire`` path. Calling :meth:`_run_fire_cycle` directly would have
        needed that whole ladder restated here, and a second copy of a
        five-condition gate is a divergence waiting to happen.

        ``delay=0.0`` rather than :meth:`_arm_from_deadline`'s
        ``_OVERDUE_REARM_SECS`` beat. That beat exists so an elapsed deadline
        does not ambush a user mid-conversation — they keep deferring it simply
        by typing. A manual trigger IS the user asking, so the condition the beat
        protects against is not present.

        Three refusals, and each one is load-bearing rather than defensive:

        * **Not registered** -> 404. Nothing to fire. This is also where the stop
          SENTINEL lands: it goes through ``remove``, so the loop is gone rather
          than merely inactive.
        * **Not active** -> 409. The non-removing terminal bounds — the cycle
          cap, the wall-clock budget and the approval stall — all leave the loop
          registered but inactive, so this ONE condition covers them without
          restating the list. A manual press must not buy a turn past a bound the
          user armed.
        * **Mid-fire** -> 409. :meth:`_arm_timer` cancels the existing timer
          task, and during the fire window that task may be parked on
          ``_persist_locked()`` writing the delivered cycle; cancelling it there
          loses the ``cycle_count`` bump. This is the same window
          ``notify_turn_complete``/``notify_user_input`` defer around, and the
          same answer the sibling immediate-trigger route gives for a run
          already in flight (``POST /api/crons/{id}/run`` -> 409).

        NO SUSPENSION POINT, and that is the design rather than an omission.
        ``async def`` for the caller's convenience, but nothing inside awaits, so
        the guards and the arm are atomic with respect to the event loop: between
        reading ``loop`` and arming it, no other coroutine can run.

        This shape was arrived at the hard way and the history is worth keeping.
        An earlier revision wrote ``next_due_ts = time.time()`` and awaited a
        DURABLE persist before arming, so a restart between the press and the
        fire would resume overdue. That await was a suspension window, and this
        module has several writers to ``next_due_ts`` that hold NO lock while
        writing it — the quiet-tick re-arm on the gated-wake branch is one. Each
        guard added to close one writer's window exposed the next: a concurrent
        ``remove`` arming a stale object, a cancelled caller abandoning the write,
        a countdown entering ``_firing`` mid-persist, a quiet tick overwriting the
        deadline, then the refused path leaving its own value durably committed.
        Five rounds, each caused by the fix before it. The window is not closable
        at this call site, because the racing writers take no lock at all.

        SO THE WRITE IS GONE. ``_arm_timer(delay=0.0)`` is what brings the cycle
        forward: :meth:`_timer` sleeps the delay it is given and fires WITHOUT
        consulting ``next_due_ts``. The write was only ever for restart cosmetics,
        and that is exactly what is given up — a gateway restart between the press
        and the fire resumes on the loop's own schedule instead of overdue, and
        the operator presses again. That is the same degradation
        :meth:`_persist_soon` documents as acceptable for every other deadline
        assignment in this class ("a lost write degrades to a fresh full countdown
        after restart, never a premature or dropped fire"), and a far better trade
        than a sixth guard on an uncloseable window.

        The countdown reset issue #8212 asks for is UNAFFECTED, because it never
        came from this write: a delivered cycle clears ``next_due_ts`` in
        :meth:`_run_fire_cycle` and the re-arm then starts a fresh full interval.
