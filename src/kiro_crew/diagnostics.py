"""Shared diagnostics / support-bundle collector.

Single code path behind both surfaces:

  * CLI  — ``kirocrew doctor --bundle``
  * UI   — Settings › About › "Report a Problem" (POST /api/diagnostics/collect)

The collector gathers the logs and crash reports needed to debug a user-reported
failure (the classic "process exited (rc=None)" ACP crash and friends), scrubs
every text member of secrets, zips them, and returns a :class:`BundleResult`
that carries a pre-filled GitHub issue URL the caller can open.

SECURITY: every text member is passed through the shared redaction pipeline
(``redact_exfiltration_urls`` then ``redact_credentials`` — same order used
everywhere else in the codebase) plus a small set of extra rules for the
patterns those two miss (``Bearer`` / ``Authorization`` headers, ``mc_token``
auth cookies, OAuth ``*_token`` JSON fields). Nothing is written to the zip
before it has been scrubbed. Sources that do not exist are skipped, never fatal.

# ── Live log reader (kiro_cli_logs MCP tool) ─────────────────────────────────
# A dedicated read-only view of kiro-cli's OWN protocol logs, so the agent
# driving kiro-cli has first-hand diagnostics when the backend rejects a turn.
# The sources sit OUTSIDE the eight fenced identity stores
# (``identity_stores.IDENTITY_STORE_ROOTS`` -> ``kiro-log/{mcp,lsp}.log`` under
# XDG_RUNTIME_DIR|TMPDIR).
#
# SCOPE IS THE SECURITY PROPERTY, not just the redaction. Two sources kiro-cli
# writes are deliberately NOT read, for the same reason:
#
# * ``sessions/cli/<sid>.jsonl`` transcripts, and
# * ``kiro-chat.log`` — one FIXED host path (see :func:`_kiro_cli_chat_log`),
#   not a per-session file, so on a host running one gateway with many
#   concurrent sessions (web, CLI, messaging, subagents, cron) it interleaves
#   every session's request/response traffic.
#
# Both carry CONVERSATION PROSE across the session boundary, and ``_scrub`` is a
# CREDENTIAL pass: it strips tokens/headers/cookies, not prose. There is no
# per-session kiro-cli chat log to scope to and no reliable per-session
# delimiter in the flat one, so an agent-callable read of it would hand session
# A's private conversation to session B with nothing to narrow it — and a
# disclosure into a model context cannot be recalled. The bundle collector still
# includes the chat log because that path is USER->USER (the user triggers the
# collection and downloads it for their own machine); this tool is CROSS-SESSION
# and therefore stays on the mcp/lsp protocol logs, which explain a rejected
# turn without carrying the conversation.
#
# This does NOT open a path carve-out on the fence: the output still flows
# through the exact ``_scrub`` stack the bundle uses
# (``redact_exfiltration_urls`` then ``redact_credentials`` then
# ``_EXTRA_REDACTIONS``), so redaction closes the credential gap while the
# narrow source list closes the conversation-content one. Two controls, because
# redaction alone cannot reach the second: it is a per-pattern pass, and
# conversation prose matches no pattern. The source list is therefore the
# primary control here and the redaction is the secondary one.
#
# THE PROPERTY THIS SCOPE DEPENDS ON, and how it is held. mcp.log / lsp.log are
# safe to read here only while they record protocol TRAFFIC (method names, ids,
# timings, errors) and not full frame BODIES. They share ``kiro-chat.log``'s
# single-fixed-path, all-sessions-interleaved shape, so payload content is the
# ONLY thing separating them, and an MCP ``tools/call`` frame carries
# conversation-derived arguments (search queries, message bodies, file contents).
#
# Measured on kiro-cli 2.21.1: mcp.log is empty (0 bytes) across a session making
# continuous MCP tool calls, and every lsp.log record is a single-line
# ``<timestamp> ERROR <module>: <message>`` with no JSON-RPC envelope and a
# longest line of 313 bytes. Sentinel strings passed as tool-call ARGUMENTS in
# that same session appear in neither file, so this binary logs no frame payloads.
#
# That is a measurement of one version, not a guarantee about a component this
# repo neither builds nor pins, so a later kiro-cli could start logging bodies.
# :func:`_looks_like_protocol_frames` is the tripwire for exactly that: a source
# whose text carries serialized frames is REFUSED whole and visibly, so the drift
# surfaces as a refusal rather than as a silent widening. Refusing the whole
# source is deliberate -- it decides only whether a file is the KIND the tool
# assumes, and never claims to separate one session's frames from another's.

#: Hard ceiling on the returned text PER SOURCE, independent of ``tail``. A log
#: tail is precisely the shape that deadlocks a pipe, so the bound is by BYTES;
#: ``tail`` (lines) narrows within it but can never raise it.
_MAX_LOG_READ_BYTES = 64 * 1024
#: Ceiling on the WHOLE assembled response, and the reason the per-source cap
#: above is divided among the sources rather than applied to each in full.
#:
#: The MCP transport has its own ceiling: every tool response leaves through
#: ``validation.build_tool_response``, which calls ``sanitize_response`` -- and
#: that truncation drops the TAIL (``text[:max_len]``). For a LOG TAIL that is
#: the worst possible end to lose: the newest lines are the entire reason the
#: tool was called, and its ``[response truncated]`` marker reads like the tool
#: cut the OLDEST content, which is the normal convention for a tail. So the
#: agent would be misled about which end it lost, not merely short-changed.
#:
#: This reader therefore does its own trimming, from the FRONT, so the newest
#: output always survives and the drop is labelled for what it is. Kept a round
#: number well under the transport's limit rather than imported from
#: ``validation``: ``diagnostics`` does not otherwise depend on that module, and
#: ``test_response_budget_stays_under_the_transport_ceiling`` imports both and
#: pins the relationship, so the invariant is enforced without the coupling.
#: (``mcp_tools/skills.py`` bounds its own fields against the same ceiling for
#: the same reason, so this is an existing contract, not a new one.)
_MAX_LOG_RESPONSE_CHARS = 80_000
#: Prepended when the response budget forced older output out. Deliberately
#: says which end went, since the transport's own marker does not.
_RESPONSE_TRIM_NOTE = (
    "...[older output dropped to fit the tool-response limit; "
    "the NEWEST lines are kept -- narrow with `tail` or `since` to see more]...\n"

def _read_log_tail(path: Path, max_bytes: int) -> str | None:
    """Tail a log file through one descriptor, refusing a symlinked final component.

    Closes the check-then-open TOCTOU window that a plain ``path.open()`` leaves:
    the source directories include the world-writable ``/tmp/kiro-log``, so a
    local principal could swap a validated regular file for a symlink to
    ``~/.ssh/config`` between the ``is_sensitive_path`` check and the read, and a
    following ``open`` would return the sensitive target's bytes (redaction is no
    backstop — a ``.ssh``/``.pem`` body matches no credential pattern).

    Where the platform offers ``O_NOFOLLOW`` (POSIX) the open uses it, so the
    kernel refuses at open time if the final component is a symlink (``ELOOP``);
    the descriptor is then ``fstat``-confirmed to be a regular file and THAT
    descriptor is tailed, so the bytes returned are provably from the path that
    was validated, not one swapped in afterward. ``O_NOFOLLOW`` guards only the
    FINAL component; the intermediate dirs are the source pickers' own fixed,
    non-symlinked anchors (``_usable_dir`` already rejects a linked ``kiro-log``).

    Where the platform lacks ``O_NOFOLLOW`` (Windows) the flag is omitted, and an
    ``is_symlink`` check plus the regular-file ``fstat`` is not enough on its own:
    a Windows JUNCTION is a reparse point ``is_symlink`` does not report, and it
    is the only link an unprivileged Windows user can create -- so the platform
    where planting one is easiest is the platform with no kernel no-follow. A
    reparse point swapped in after the check and pointing at a regular sensitive
    file satisfies ``S_ISREG``, and its bytes would reach the caller.

    An IDENTITY MATCH closes that, and it closes it on every platform rather than
    only the one missing a flag. ``os.lstat`` describes the path WITHOUT following
    its final component, ``os.fstat`` describes what the descriptor actually
    opened, and this function refuses unless the two name the same file
    (``st_dev``/``st_ino``; on Windows those come from the file's volume and
    index). Two things fail that comparison: a final component that is a link of
    any kind, because ``lstat`` sees the link while the descriptor sees its
    target, and a swap landing between the ``lstat`` and the open, because the
    descriptor then holds a different file. So the bytes returned are provably
    from the path that was checked. ``O_NOFOLLOW`` remains a POSIX
    STRENGTHENING -- it refuses at open time rather than after -- not a
    precondition for reading.

    This is the module's ONLY tail reader: both the agent-facing
    :func:`read_kiro_cli_logs` and :func:`collect_bundle` read through it, so the
    check-then-open hardening cannot be present in one path and missing in the
    other (a second reader with mirrored comments would drift).

    Returns ``None`` (skip this source) on any refusal or non-regular file rather
    than raising. The byte cut lands on a LINE boundary, same as the bundle
    collector's own tail: a cut inside ``Authorization: Basic <b64>`` would keep
    the credential and drop the header token that redacts it, so the partial
    first line is discarded. When the window holds NO newline at all -- the
    file's final line is itself longer than ``max_bytes`` -- there is no boundary
    to cut on and the whole chunk is a partial line, so only the truncation
    marker is returned. That case loses one oversized entry, which is the
    correct trade against emitting a fragment whose redaction anchor was cut
    away.

    ``O_NONBLOCK`` is set for the same check-then-open window: ``O_NOFOLLOW``
    refuses a swapped-in SYMLINK, but the same local writer to the world-writable
    ``/tmp/kiro-log`` can swap the validated regular file for a FIFO, and an
    ``O_RDONLY`` open of a FIFO with no writer BLOCKS INDEFINITELY — the
    ``S_ISREG`` guard below cannot run, because it only sees a descriptor the
    open already returned, so the agent's tool call would hang rather than be
    refused. With ``O_NONBLOCK`` the FIFO open returns immediately and the
    ``S_ISREG`` check then rejects it. It is a no-op for the regular-file case
    (``O_NONBLOCK`` has no effect on regular-file reads).

    Reads ONLY the ``kiro-log`` mcp/lsp log files — never the fenced identity
    stores, and deliberately NOT the two conversation-bearing sources kiro-cli
    also writes:

    * ``sessions/cli/<sid>.jsonl`` transcripts, and
    * ``kiro-chat.log``, which is ONE fixed host path rather than a per-session
      file, so a host running one gateway with many concurrent sessions
      interleaves every session's traffic into it.

    Both are conversation content shared across every gateway session (including
    incognito/temporary ones), and ``_scrub`` is a CREDENTIAL pass that does not
    narrow prose — so returning either would disclose another session's private
    conversation to the calling session, with no per-session delimiter available
    to filter on. This tool therefore stays on the mcp/lsp protocol logs, which
    are what explain a rejected turn. :func:`collect_bundle` still includes the
    chat log because that path is user-to-user (the user triggers the collection
    and downloads it themselves); this one is cross-session.

    Every source is byte-capped, line-tailed to ``tail`` (default
    :data:`_DEFAULT_LOG_TAIL`), optionally filtered to lines at/after ``since``,
    and then passed through the shared redaction stack via :func:`_scrub`.
    Returns a human-readable report with one ``===`` section per source, or a
    note when no logs exist.

    Output is bounded at BOTH levels, and the second one exists because of which
    END the transport drops. :data:`_MAX_LOG_READ_BYTES` caps each source (a log
    tail is the shape that deadlocks a pipe, so that bound is by BYTES; ``tail``
    narrows lines within it but can never raise it), and
    :data:`_MAX_LOG_RESPONSE_CHARS` caps the whole assembled response. Every MCP
    response leaves through ``validation.build_tool_response``, whose
    ``sanitize_response`` truncates the TAIL -- so left alone it would drop the
    NEWEST log lines, the entire reason a tail was requested, behind a marker
    that reads like the oldest were cut. This function therefore trims its own
    output from the FRONT and labels the drop, so the newest lines always
    survive.

    The read goes through :func:`_read_log_tail`, which opens each source and
    (where the platform offers ``O_NOFOLLOW``) refuses a symlinked final
    component at open time, tailing that same descriptor — so a symlink swapped in
    after the ``is_sensitive_path`` check (the source dirs include the shared
    ``/tmp/kiro-log``) is refused at open time rather than followed to a
    sensitive target. Redaction runs AFTER truncation on purpose: the byte cut
    lands on a line boundary, so no credential is separated from the header token
    that redacts it.
