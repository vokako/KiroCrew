        Every ``state.json`` writer inside a run goes through here, for two
        reasons that are both load-bearing.

        OFF-LOOP, because ``update_state`` ends in a synchronous fsync and a
        slow FS must not freeze the gateway/heartbeat (#6288). Running in a pool
        thread also means the write TAKES ``update_state``'s per-agent lock,
        which off-loop callers hold and on-loop callers deliberately skip
        (#7280).

        DRAINED ON CANCELLATION, because cancelling a ``to_thread`` await
        detaches the worker without stopping it, and ``update_state`` rewrites
        the WHOLE file from the snapshot it already read — so a detached worker
        rolls back every field written after that read, not merely the fields it
        names. That is how a zombie erases the ``pid`` / ``session_id`` a
        cancel-respawn recovery run writes on the loop, or the retention
        ``keep`` that promote / release write on the loop (#6306, #6298, #6308).
        Cancellation is therefore held open until the worker finishes — but
        BOUNDED: ``cancel_all()`` gathers run tasks with no timeout, so an
        unbounded drain on a wedged FS would hold gateway shutdown forever, and
        this module's convention is that bounded shutdown plus recoverable state
        beats unbounded shutdown (same posture as ``_REPORT_DRAIN_TIMEOUT``).
        ``asyncio.wait`` never cancels its members, so repeated cancels of the
        awaiting task keep the worker future intact while the drain loop waits
        out the same deadline. For the whole window in which the worker may still
        write -- from the cancellation until the worker settles, however the drain
        exits -- the run HOLDS its conversation
        (``SubagentManager._abandoned_state_writers``), so the two on-loop
        ``keep`` writes are deferred past the worker instead of being rolled back
        by it. The window starts at the cancellation rather than at the drain
        deadline because on Python 3.10 a second outer cancel can finalize the run
        mid-drain.

        Returns ``update_state``'s own report: True when the merge was written,
        False when it was SKIPPED because the state was unreadable — a caller
        with a durability contract (the pre-spawn provenance write, #5394)
        retries on False. Re-raises ``asyncio.CancelledError`` after draining,
        so such a retry loop ends on cancellation instead of adding a second
        writer for the same fields.
