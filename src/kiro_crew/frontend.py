"""Shared helpers for building the KiroCrew website frontend assets.

The canonical frontend lives **in-tree** at ``<repo-root>/website`` (a Vite +
React app). Its ``npm run build`` output lands in ``<repo-root>/website/dist``
and must be staged into ``<repo-root>/src/kiro_crew/static/dist`` so the
gateway can serve the SPA. Everything here operates on that in-tree layout.

For backwards compatibility with side-by-side dev checkouts, a *sibling*
``KiroCrewWebsite/dist`` clone is honored as a last-resort fallback when
resolving an already-built dist at runtime (see ``ensure_dev_dist_symlink``).

    an inherited-but-incomplete environment decides which edition gets built —

    A downstream edition sets both vars in its own build script. If the rebuild

    for a *running* gateway too: aiohttp resolves a static route's directory once
    at registration, so a gateway started while ``static/dist`` was a symlink
    (see :func:`ensure_dev_dist_symlink`) is pinned to ``website/dist`` for its
    whole life and 404s while Vite rewrites that directory. Staging makes the
    NEXT start serve an independent tree.

    The copy lands in a temporary sibling and is swapped in with a single
    ``os.replace``, so a concurrently-serving gateway never sees a half-copied
    tree. The live tree is moved aside rather than deleted, and restored if the
