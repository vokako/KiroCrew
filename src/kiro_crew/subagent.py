    the *limit* dropped (``0`` when nothing was dropped, so a caller appends its
    "+N more" only when there is a remainder to report).

    Three surfaces render this roster -- an unknown-agent refusal, the spawn
    tools' parameter descriptions, and ``spawn_list``'s output -- and all three
    come through the pipeline below rather than re-implementing it. Duplicated
    copies drift, so the SAFETY half lives here where a fourth surface cannot
    omit it:

    * **Grammar.** Every name must match ``_AGENT_NAME_RE`` before it is
      rendered. This is the load-bearing filter, not a tidiness check: an agent
      spec's ``name`` field is taken verbatim by
      ``agent_discovery._global_agent_info`` with no validation, so a spec can
      declare a name containing a newline plus instruction-shaped text -- which
      is pure ASCII, so an ``isascii`` check passes it -- and it would ride this
      string into a model's context. ``SPAWN_RUN_SCHEMA`` gates the ``agent``
      parameter on the same grammar, so a name that fails it could never have
      been dispatched anyway: offering it would advertise an unusable name.
    * **Redaction.** A grammar-valid name can still be credential-shaped (an
      AWS access key is pure alphanumerics), so each name goes through the
      canonical context-aware shim rather than being trusted.
    * **Bound.** Every rendered roster that reaches always-on context is capped,
      and the remainder is returned as a count instead of being silently lost.

    Order is the CALLER's: this returns names in the order it received them, so
    each surface keeps the presentation its own copy promises. *exclude* defaults
    to the reserved pair (reached by omitting ``agent``, never by naming one);
    ``spawn_list`` passes an empty set on purpose, because the two bounded
    rosters point at it as the surface that lists everything.

    Consequence, stated plainly: a project agent is accepted only once that
