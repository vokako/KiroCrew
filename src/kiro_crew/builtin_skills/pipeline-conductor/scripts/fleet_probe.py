"""Batch fleet probe — the deterministic half of the pipeline conductor's patrol.

One invocation answers, for every watched worker session, "does anything need
judgment this cycle?" — plus host posture — so a quiet patrol cycle costs one
script call and a couple of output lines instead of N transcript reads.

Usage:
    python3 fleet_probe.py --config <probe-config.json>
    python3 fleet_probe.py --config <probe-config.json> --mark-handled KEY TAG DIGEST

Config (JSON):
    {
      "sessions": ["dashboard_chat-601-1788099254", ...],   # slot keys to watch
      "idle_alert_secs": 900,      # silent longer than this -> IDLE alert
      "tail_bytes": 200000,        # per-session transcript PARSE cap
      "load_alert_per_cpu": 1.5,   # 1-min loadavg / cpu above this -> hot
      "err_res": [...],            # extra error-tail regexes (optional)
      "banned_process_res": [...], # cmdline regexes for banned ops (optional)
      "init_timeout_res": [...],   # initialize-timeout tails (optional)
      "watchdog_res": [...],       # turn-ended-by-stall-watchdog tails (optional)
      "fleet_worktrees": [...]     # absolute roots this fleet owns (optional)
    }

Every regex key is validated at load time: a bad pattern is malformed config
(exit 2 with the offending pattern), never a crash mid-cycle. ``tail_bytes``
caps how much of a transcript is PARSED, not how much is read -- the whole file
is read either way, which is what makes the tail index monotonic for free.

Paths are DERIVED, never configurable -- the same containment rule for every
location this script touches, because its config is authored by a no-write
agent and a config-chosen path would quietly widen what an approved run can
reach:

  * transcripts are read from ``<data home>/sessions`` only, where the data
    home is ``$KIROCREW_HOME`` (else ``~/.kiro/crew``) -- the gateway this
    conductor belongs to, not an arbitrary directory;
  * the handled-set state file is ALWAYS ``<config path>.state.json``;
  * the banned-process scan reads ``/proc`` (``$KIROCREW_PROBE_PROC_ROOT``
    exists for the test harness).

A session key that does not match a transcript stem directly is also tried as
``dashboard_<key>`` (and with ``:`` as ``_``): ``session_create`` answers slot
keys while the store prefixes the surface, and a raw key must not read as a
missing session -- GONE triggers reclaim, and a false GONE is how an active
item gets duplicate-dispatched.

The data home is ``$KIROCREW_HOME`` when set, else ``~/.kiro/crew`` — the same
resolution every pipeline script uses.

Output (text, one line per FIRING signal; suppressed sessions print nothing):
    🔔 <session-key> <age>s <TAG> i=<index> d=<digest>

``i=`` counts the rows that SESSION PRODUCED -- its own messages and tool calls,
never an inbound nudge, inject or user row, because a supervisor's own nudge
landing in the file must not read as the worker making progress. It is a
monotonic per-session position counted from the start of the file, not from the
window, so it cannot saturate once a transcript passes ``tail_bytes``. An
unchanged count since the conductor last acted is *no progress*, whether or not
a turn is open, and that is the discriminator a self-deadlocked worker cannot
fake -- the probe makes that comparison itself and fires ``NOPROGRESS`` rather
than leaving two numbers for someone to diff. It is a position, so it carries no
transcript content.

Metadata only, by design: transcript-derived text never appears in the output,
so no private session content crosses into the caller's context whatever keys
the config watches. Content, when a ruling needs it, is read through the
workspace-authorized session tools.
    BANNED pid=<pid> rule=<regex> cwd=fleet|unknown age=<secs|?>s
    OK <n> watched, <m> fired | load/cpu <x> (<posture>) | mem <G>G
       | banned <k> | foreign <k> | deliver init-timeout <a>, watchdog <b>

``banned`` counts fleet-owned matches only -- a banned command shape running in
an unrelated checkout on the same host is somebody else's business, and counting
it made the conductor stop a worker that was not the offender. Those are
summarised as ``foreign`` and not printed. ``deliver`` is the honest admission
instrument: load and memory can both read healthy while the fleet cannot
deliver, so sessions whose tail carries an initialize timeout or a
stall-watchdog turn end are counted every cycle, fired or not.

Tags: the worker protocol words (``WORKING/PR/GREEN/BLOCKED/STANDDOWN/
PROPOSAL``) -- recognised in their protocol form, ``<WORD>:``, so prose that
merely opens with one is not a report -- plus ``ERR`` for an error/throttle
tail, ``IDLE`` for silence past the threshold, ``TERMINAL`` for a session whose
last dispositioned report ENDED its assignment (``GREEN``/``STANDDOWN``/
``PROPOSAL``) and which has since written unprefixed text, ``NOPROGRESS`` for a
session that has produced nothing since the conductor last acted on it, and
``-`` when a tail carries no tag
(never fires on its own). Tool rows never classify: a protocol word or an error
phrase inside a tool card is quoted text, not a report.

The tag is the newest REPORT, not the newest message, because ``BLOCKED`` is
STICKY: a probe samples rather than subscribes, and the protocol requires a
blocked worker to keep reporting status, so its own next message would displace
the only thing a newest-message classifier reads. A heartbeat (``WORKING``) and
unprefixed text leave a sticky report standing; any other report supersedes it.
``TERMINAL`` and sticky ``BLOCKED`` are kept distinct on purpose -- one says
close me, the other says a ruling is owed.

Leading markdown decoration is stripped before the tag is matched, because the
match is anchored at position zero and ``**BLOCKED:**`` puts an asterisk there.
Emphasis, blockquote arrows, heading hashes and list markers all count. The
normalisation applies to the MATCHED text only: the digest is still computed over
what the worker wrote, and the anchor survives, so a bolded protocol word
mid-sentence is still not a report.

THE HANDLED SET replaces the overnight run's hand-grown ``grep -vE`` exclusion
pipe. Every fired line carries a ``d=<digest>`` field; ``--mark-handled KEY TAG
DIGEST`` records exactly that digest into the state file (compare-and-set: if
the tail moved on since the probe, the mark is REFUSED with exit 3 so the
caller re-probes instead of suppressing a payload nobody read). A signal is
then suppressed while (tag, digest) both still match. A new payload under the
same tag re-fires (a second GREEN with a new PR number is a new signal).
``IDLE`` marks expire after another ``idle_alert_secs``
so a nudged-but-still-silent worker re-alerts instead of vanishing.

A handled entry also records the tail ``index`` at the moment of the mark, and
the last dispositioned PAYLOAD report as ``settled`` (its tag AND digest) -- one
field, written on every mark and carried forward when the mark is not itself a
payload, so no later disposition can erase the fact that a report was already
answered. Neither field takes part in the digest, and a state file written before
they existed still suppresses exactly as it did; a legacy ``proto`` field, which
recorded only the tag, is still read so an in-place upgrade keeps its terminal
reading.

Deliberately boring properties, do not weaken:
  * No subprocess, ever. Reads transcripts, ``/proc`` and ``loadavg`` directly.
  * The only write is the probe's own state file, atomically, and only on
    ``--mark-handled``.
  * A per-session problem (unreadable file, malformed line) degrades that one
    row, never the cycle. Exit 0 when the probe ran; 2 on malformed config.

#: opened with a bare ``PR #<n>``), so one row in five carried a fabricated tag.
#:
#: Built FROM ``PROTO_TAGS`` rather than spelling the six words a second time,
#: because two copies of one list diverge. Longest first, so a word that is a
#: prefix of another is never tried after it: ``PR`` and ``PROPOSAL`` share two
#: characters, and while Python's alternation backtracks and would match either
#: way, ordering by length makes that correctness independent of backtracking.

    and the line falls through as no-prefix. On a fresh transcript IDLE does not
    fire either, so the report is not delayed or suppressed -- it is silent.

    That is worth normalising rather than legislating, because emphasis is
    ordinary formatting habit rather than a protocol violation, and a convention
    the worker has to remember fails exactly when the worker is under pressure --
    which is when escalations get written. The robust half has to be the reader.

    only the text this function MATCHES against. Callers keep the raw text for

    The anchor survives normalisation: decoration is stripped from the FRONT, so
    a bolded protocol word mid-sentence still does not set a tag. This is not a

#: worker to keep reporting status, so its own next message displaces the only
#: place a sampling probe looks. The debt then exists on both sides and is
#: visible to neither: the worker holds position waiting for a ruling, and the
#: conductor never learned it owes one.
#:
#: Sticky is what survives the sample. A sticky report is not cleared by a

#: eventually pushes its own report past ``tail_bytes`` (200 KB), and the ruling
#: debt goes invisible again -- the same loss class this fixes, deferred rather
#: than closed. Raising ``tail_bytes`` buys proportionally more time; making it
#: unconditional would mean parsing every transcript in full on every cycle.
#:
#: The durable handled set cannot close it, which is worth spelling out because it
#: looks like it should. ``proto`` there is written ONLY by ``--mark-handled``, so
#: it exists exactly when the ruling has already been delivered -- and in that
#: case the signal is correctly suppressed by digest, so reading it would change
#: nothing. In the case the bound actually bites, an UNDISPOSITIONED report ageing
#: out, there is no mark and therefore no recorded tag to read. Sourcing

    The banned-operation rules are matched against the whole joined cmdline, which

    is a statement about the ARGUMENTS, and ``\\bpytest\\b(?!.*-n\\s*\\d)`` reads
    boundedness out of them. The cost of matching that far is that a wrapper's
    argument is read as the wrapper's own program: ``bash -c 'cd x && pytest -q'``
    is reported as an unbounded pytest while the process that exists is a shell.

    Skipping the wrapper removes a misattribution and loses no coverage, because
    the probe scans EVERY process: a genuinely running wrapped tool has its own
    pid and is matched there on its own merits. Attributing it to the wrapper as
    well only makes the conductor stop the wrong pid.

    That "loses no coverage" argument rests on the wrapped tool still being alive
    at the next ``/proc`` walk, which is true of the two built-in rules and NOT
    guaranteed of an operator's own. The caller therefore consults this function
    only for a match on a built-in rule; a custom ``banned_process_res`` reports
    the wrapper as it did before the fix.

    Takes real ARGV, not a joined string. Once NUL separators become spaces, an
    argument containing a space is indistinguishable from two arguments, so the
    option/operand structure this function has to read is no longer recoverable.

    BusyBox is a multi-call binary, so the applet -- not ``busybox`` -- is the
    effective program, and it is resolved before the option scan starts. Which

    two spellings puts it in argv[1]:

    * through a SYMLINK, the standard form -- ``argv[0]`` is the applet
      (``/usr/bin/wget``) while ``exe`` resolves to busybox itself
    * explicit multi-call dispatch -- ``busybox sh -c '...'`` names the applet in
      argv[1], where every other shell would put an option

    Reading argv[1] for the symlink form left ``base`` as ``busybox``, which is a

    bearing. A program path UNDER a fleet worktree is conclusive: nothing outside
    that checkout runs its interpreter. A program path outside one is only
    conclusive when it is a venv interpreter, which belongs to whichever checkout
    created it. A system or shim interpreter attributes nothing -- and that is the
    fleet's own case, not a hypothetical: a fleet worktree here has no ``.venv``
    and its workers run a global ``python3`` shim, so treating "not under a fleet
    worktree" as ``foreign`` would classify a real banned run INSIDE the fleet as
    somebody else's and never print it. That is the exact harm 2d exists to
    prevent, so the non-match stays ``unknown``.

    An empty or unset ``fleet_worktrees`` declares no scope, and scoping against
    an empty set would classify every match as ``foreign`` and mute the banned
    signal entirely -- a failure the conductor cannot see. Unscoped therefore
    means ``unknown``: every match is still reported and still counted, which is
    exactly the pre-2d behaviour.

    The comparison gets a second chance through ``realpath`` because a match
    missed is a banned run inside the fleet reported as somebody else's: it
    absorbs a symlinked worktree root and a Windows short (8.3) name, either of
    which spells the same directory a way the literal form does not.

    """How many seconds the process at *pid* has been alive, or None.

    The reader problem the age solves: a bare ``BANNED pid=`` line is the same
    every cycle whether the process the conductor stopped is still running or a
    new offender holds its recycled number -- pids are recycled, so the number
    alone cannot tell those apart, and a re-emitted line reads as either
    "handled, ignore" or "still burning the host" with no way to choose. The
    process's own age settles it: an age that grows across cycles marks one
    process still alive; a small age under a recycled number marks a fresh
    violation. The age is a fact about the running process, so it costs no state
    file and no second writer -- the probe stays read-only outside
    ``--mark-handled``.

    Both reads are world-readable like ``/proc/<pid>/cmdline`` (the field this
    scan trusts), so a process owned by another user answers here even though its
    ``cwd``/``exe`` links do not. ``proc_root`` is threaded through rather than
    ``/proc`` hardcoded, so the test harness's ``KIROCREW_PROBE_PROC_ROOT``
    supplies both files, under the same containment rule as every other path here.

    ``/proc/<pid>/stat`` field 22 is ``starttime`` in clock ticks since boot.
    The ``comm`` field (field 2) can hold spaces and parentheses, so the parse
    resumes after the last ``)``; a comm like ``(sh )nasty)`` keeps its own
    parentheses out of the field split. Any unreadable or malformed input returns
    None, which the caller renders as ``age=?s`` -- the same handling as an
    unreadable cwd, and never crashes the scan.

    The source is ``/proc`` plus ``os.sysconf`` for the clock tick rate, both
    POSIX-only. On a platform without them the age is genuinely uncomputable, so
    this returns None and the caller emits ``age=?s`` there too. The field is
    never omitted: a missing field would read as "no age" and let a reader assume
    the process is new, while ``age=?s`` says the age is unavailable. There is no
    stdlib-only process create-time source on Windows, so ``age=?s`` is the honest
    answer rather than a number from a guessed tick rate.
