"""File one finding against the ledger: validate its shape, then dedupe it.

One record per real defect. A surface re-audited in a later round must not
re-file what is already recorded, so this script never inserts blindly: it hands
the candidate to ``ledger.add_finding``, whose identity is
``(surface, title, sorted paths)`` and which returns the EXISTING id on a hit.

Usage::

    python3 finding_entry.py [--db PATH] [--roe-json PATH] \\
        --surface S --severity SEV --title T --path P [--path P ...] \\
        --poc POC [--round-id R]
    python3 finding_entry.py [--db PATH] --json-file FINDING.json

The two input modes exist because an auditor produces a finding two ways. It
files one it just found from its own flags; and the RFC has it "emit one
structured finding file per candidate", which is what ``--json-file`` reads back.
Same validation, same dedupe, one writer.

Exit codes::

    0  filed -- a new finding, and ``created`` is true
    3  duplicate -- nothing written, and the EXISTING id is still printed
    2  invalid input -- nothing written

stdout is one JSON object, ``{"finding_id": N, "created": true|false}``, on the
success and the duplicate path alike. A duplicate prints the id because the
caller's next step (dispatch a verifier, cite it in a report) needs the handle,
and making it parse stderr for it would be the same information behind a worse
contract.

**Why a malformed finding fails HERE and not later.** ``report_schema`` in the
rules of engagement names the fields a finding must carry, and the verifier pass
is the whole product -- so every requirement below exists because the record is
useless to a verifier without it:

- ``--severity`` must be a level ``severity_scale`` names. A grade invented
  outside the scale cannot be adjudicated, and severity is what drives the fixer
  gate. When no ``severity_scale`` rule can be read, that is a REFUSAL (exit 2),
  not a pass: an unvalidatable grade is exactly what the scale exists to stop.
- ``--poc`` must be present and must be a shape ``verify_finding.py`` can run.
  The check is that script's OWN parser, loaded as a sibling rather than a second
  list of prefixes here -- write-time validation and the verifier then cannot
  drift apart, so adding a third proof shape cannot leave this script rejecting
  what the verifier runs.
- At least one ``--path``, because the paths are part of the dedupe identity and
  of after-the-fact scope checking.

Reads and writes one SQLite file through ``ledger.py``. No network, no
subprocess.
