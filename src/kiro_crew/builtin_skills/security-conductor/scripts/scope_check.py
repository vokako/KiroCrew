"""Is this repository, path or technique inside the rules of engagement?

The conductor decides scope with this script, never by its own judgment about
what seems reasonable: a tone instruction degrades silently across a long
session, and a scope verdict is testable. **Exit codes are the interface** --
stdout carries the reasons, the exit code carries the answer:

===  ==================  ================================================
  0  ``IN_SCOPE``        every asked-about item is covered by an active rule
 10  ``OUT_OF_SCOPE``    a ``forbidden`` rule matched, or an item is covered
                         by no ``scope`` / ``allowed_techniques`` rule
 20  ``UNKNOWN``         no rules, an unreadable database, a rule this script
                         cannot interpret, or nothing asked
 30  ``NEEDS_APPROVAL``  a technique the ``human_approval`` gate names
===  ==================  ================================================

``UNKNOWN`` IS NEVER PERMISSION. It is a distinct nonzero code rather than a
flavour of zero precisely so a caller that only checks ``rc == 0`` cannot read
"I could not tell" as "go ahead". ``NEEDS_APPROVAL`` is nonzero for the same
reason: the gate is held by not proceeding, and only a human lifts it.

Usage::

    python3 scope_check.py [--db PATH] [--roe-json PATH] \\
        [--repo NAME] [--path P ...] [--technique T ...]

Where the rules come from. The ACTIVE ``roe_rules`` rows are the source of
truth, read straight out of the ledger (``ledger.py``, ``--db`` overriding
``ledger.default_db_path()``). ``rules-of-engagement.json`` beside the skill is
an EXPORT, so it is consulted ONLY when the database holds zero rule ROWS, and
that substitution is announced on stderr -- a scope answer that came from a file
somebody could edit without leaving a row behind should say so out loud.

Two things are NOT fallback triggers, because neither says the ledger is empty:

- **An unreadable database.** It told us nothing, so the answer is ``UNKNOWN``.
- **Rows that exist with none active.** That is the RFC's revert path -- a bad
  rule is undone by flipping ``active``, not by deleting it -- so reading it as
  "no rules" and consulting the export restored the very scope the revert
  removed. Every rule revoked means there is no scope to check against:
  ``UNKNOWN``.

The value grammar this script can interpret, and nothing else:

``repo:<name>``
    Matches ``--repo`` exactly, case-insensitively.
``path:<prefix>``
    Matches a ``--path`` that IS the prefix or sits under it, compared by whole
    path segment so ``path:src`` never covers ``srcfoo``. The query is
    normalised first, so ``src/../../etc/passwd`` cannot borrow ``src/``'s
    coverage.
``technique:<slug>`` or a bare slug
    A technique. In ``allowed_techniques`` and ``human_approval`` -- the two
    fields that GRANT -- those two forms are the ONLY interpretable ones: a
    ``repo:`` or ``path:`` value there is malformed, and since the matcher
    compares the value with its prefix stripped, reading one anyway let
    ``path:network-egress`` authorise the technique ``network-egress``.

**A rule that PERMITS is matched exactly; only a rule that REFUSES is matched by
containment.** ``allowed_techniques`` and ``human_approval`` need whole-value
equality, because containment there let a fragment stand in for the whole:
``--technique unit`` matched the allowed ``local-unit-poc`` and came back
``IN_SCOPE`` for a technique no rule authorises. ``forbidden`` keeps containment,
since its values are negative phrases -- ``no-network-egress-from-a-poc`` -- and
matching ``--technique network-egress`` against it is the point. The asymmetry is
the invariant: widening only ever widens what is refused.

``severity_scale`` and ``report_schema`` rows are not scope inputs; they are
skipped, and their presence never makes a verdict ``UNKNOWN``. Any OTHER field
name, and any value whose form is not above, is a rule this script cannot
interpret -- recorded and reported, never guessed at.

Precedence, in evaluation order:

1. a ``forbidden`` match, which no other rule trades against;
2. no interpretable rules at all -- there is nothing to check against;
3. an item no rule covers;
4. a ``human_approval`` technique that is not also allowed;
5. a rule that could not be interpreted;
6. otherwise in scope.

Reads one SQLite file (SELECT only) or one JSON file. No network, no subprocess,
and no write anywhere -- including no creation of an absent database, so asking
a scope question never leaves a ledger behind.
