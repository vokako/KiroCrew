"""Re-run one finding's proof of concept and record the verdict.

Hallucinated vulnerabilities are the dominant noise source in agentic security
review, so every finding gets an independent second pass whose job is REJECTING
it. This script is that pass's only writer: the conductor reads the verdict it
records and never reads a verifier's prose and decides for itself.

Usage::

    python3 verify_finding.py [--db PATH] --finding-id N --worktree DIR \\
        [--timeout SECONDS]

Exit codes, which are the interface::

    0   confirmed    -- the proof reproduces
    10  rejected     -- it does not reproduce
    20  needs-human  -- it cannot be settled here: refused, timed out, or the
                        proof did not actually run
    2   invalid input -- no such finding, a bad timeout, an unrunnable PoC
                        shape; NOTHING is recorded, because a verdict about a
                        finding that is not there has nothing to attach to

stdout is one JSON object: ``{"finding_id": N, "verdict": V, "reason": R}``.
Every verdict this script reaches is appended through
``ledger.record_verdict(role="verifier", ...)``, so the disagreement with the
auditor stays readable instead of being overwritten by whoever wrote last.

The two proof shapes::

    pytest::<nodeid>     a unit-level test that FAILS while the defect is present
    cmd::<argv ...>      a command that exits NONZERO while the defect is present

``cmd::`` is split with ``shlex`` and run WITHOUT a shell, so a pipe, a
redirection or a substitution in a PoC is an argument rather than an operator.

**Neither lane may read its verdict off an exit status alone**, and both for the
same reason: a nonzero exit means "this did not succeed", which covers "the
defect reproduced" AND "the proof never ran". Confirming a finding on a proof
that never ran is the exact false positive this pass exists to catch.

- ``pytest::`` takes its verdict from a **JUnit XML report written outside the
  worktree**, never from the run's stdout. The audited checkout is untrusted by
  construction, so anything it PRINTS is attacker-controlled: a hostile
  ``conftest.py`` emitting ``1 failed`` and exiting 1 forged a confirmation
  while the named test never ran. A structured report keyed to the requested
  nodeid closes that. It is not proof against the checkout itself -- code that
  runs can also write the report it was asked to produce, or exit before writing
  one -- but a missing, unparseable or unrelated report is ``needs-human``, so
  the failure direction is toward a human rather than toward a confirmation.
- ``cmd::`` treats **launch-failure shapes as ``needs-human``**: a spawn error,
  a death by signal, and exit 126/127 all mean the command did not run. Only a
  command that ran and exited nonzero confirms.

**The refusal screen.** A PoC is refused, unrun, as ``needs-human`` when it
carries a shape the rules of engagement forbid outright, or when ``--worktree``
is not a git checkout -- "in a scratch checkout" is the entire blast-radius
bound, and an unverified directory is not one. The screened shapes:

- network egress (``curl``, ``wget``, ``nc``, ``ssh``) and ``token``, applied to
  a ``cmd::`` PoC's argv only. A ``pytest::`` nodeid is a test SELECTOR, not a
  program: it cannot itself reach the network, so word-screening it buys nothing
  -- what the selected test DOES was never visible to a string screen -- while
  refusing real nodeids from this codebase's dominant finding class, wherever a
  screened word stands alone: a parametrised id (``test_token[query]``), a module
  (``token.py``), a directory (``ssh/``).
- credential paths (``~/.aws``, ``~/.ssh``, the crew config), applied to both
  shapes, since no legitimate nodeid names one.
- a ``cmd::`` argument that is an absolute path or contains a ``..`` segment --
  the write-outside-the-worktree shape.

This screen is a NAMED-SHAPE CHECK, not a sandbox. It reads the PoC string that
was filed and refuses the shapes above; it cannot stop a program that reaches
the network, or writes outside the worktree, by some other name. There is no
stdlib OS sandbox to run this under, so the real boundary is the rules of
engagement plus the host's own policy gate, and a refusal here is a report to a
human rather than a claim that anything was contained.

What the child process gets: the PoC's argv, ``cwd`` set to the worktree, a
minimal environment, and a deadline. ``HOME`` points AT the worktree, so a
``~``-relative credential path resolves inside the throwaway checkout instead of
into the operator's real home.

Reads and writes one SQLite file through ``ledger.py``, and runs exactly one
subprocess. No network of its own.
