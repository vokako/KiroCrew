"""Plane-C publish-governance chokepoint — "may this box publish to <destination>?".

Publishing is a user-driven dashboard HTTP action ("NOT LLM tools"), so the host
PreToolUse gate never sees it.  :func:`publish_denied_reason` is where the
``capabilities.publish`` ceiling and the standalone operator's
``config.publish.allowed_destinations`` allowlist are enforced instead.

It lives in its own module (rather than inside ``dashboard/handlers/artifacts.py``,
where it started) because there is more than one publish surface and they must
share ONE decision, not each grow their own:

* ``api_artifact_publish`` and its sharing/review siblings — the artifact
  registry destinations (``dashboard/handlers/artifacts.py``).
* ``/api/deploy/deploy`` and the ``deploy-web-aws`` row of
  ``GET /api/publish-providers`` — the public-web deploy path, whose destination
  id is :data:`DEPLOY_WEB_PROVIDER_ID`.

Layering (tightest wins):

1. the governance ceiling ∩ profile — the ``capabilities.publish`` gate AND its
   inner ``destinations`` ruleset (item ``destinations:<provider>``).  Read from
   the trust-root ``security_policy.json``, which the agent can neither read nor
   rewrite, so this is the durable operator control;
2. ``config.publish.allowed_destinations`` — the standalone operator's
   narrowing knob (default-open; empty list allows every destination).  It can
   only NARROW: a destination the ceiling denies is never re-permitted here,
   because the security policy is never merged from ``config.json``.

Disposition on error: publishing is an **authorization** decision (bytes leave
the box), so unlike the messaging/cron chokepoints it fails **CLOSED** rather
than degrading to permit. That includes a config we cannot parse:
``KiroCrewConfig.load()`` degrades to defaults on a malformed file, which would
present a narrowed ``allowed_destinations`` as the empty allow-all one, so this
module checks parseability itself rather than inheriting that degrade.

    """Return ``(allowlist, denial_reason)`` from ONE read of the config.

    The two questions this gate needs — "is the config trustworthy" and "what
    did the operator allow" — are answered from a single ``load()``, because
    answering them from two independent reads is what let a malformed section
    reopen the allowlist.

    Two independent reads cannot do it: a probe like ``read_config_for_update``
    (which rejects only a non-object TOP level) plus a value taken from
    ``KiroCrewConfig.load().publish.allowed_destinations`` passes a ``config.json``
    of ``{"publish": []}`` — a valid object at the top level — and the loader then
    coerces the non-dict ``publish`` section to ``{}``, so the allowlist comes back
    empty. Empty is indistinguishable from "no restriction configured", i.e.
    default-open. A malformed section would not deny publishing and would not
    surface an error; it would remove the restriction.

    Re-reading the FILE here cannot fix that, which is worth stating because it
    is the obvious approach: ``load()`` runs a migration that REWRITES
    ``config.json`` in normalized form, so after the gateway's first load the
    malformed section is gone from disk and any later re-read sees a clean file
    with an empty allowlist. The loader is the only place that ever sees the
    degradation, so it is the loader that reports it — via
    ``degraded_sections``.

    Two shapes deny: a config FILE that could not be read as a JSON object, and
    a ``publish`` section present but not an object. Both arrive through
    ``degraded_sections``.

    NOT handled here, deliberately: a malformed ``allowed_destinations`` INSIDE
    a well-formed section. The loader normalizes that value before this function
    can see it — its comprehension iterates whatever it is given, so the string
    ``"deploy-web"`` becomes the character list ``["d", "e", ...]`` — and a
    check here would be dead code that only looked like a guard. It is the same
    class one level down and wants the same treatment (the loader reporting what
    it discarded), which is a change to the loader's per-field parsing rather
    than to this gate. Filed separately rather than half-done here.

    An ABSENT config or section is not degraded: genuinely unconfigured, and an
    unnamed publish is ungoverned and permitted, so a standalone host is
    unaffected.
