"""Structured header facts for sub-agent completion cards.

A finished sub-agent's result is injected into the parent session as the next
turn's input (see ``gateway._subagent_done``). The dashboard renders that
injected text as a compact card instead of the machine-facing prompt it is; to
decide the outcome, tallies, and headline it needs the header FACTS — which
agent, success or failure, how much of a wave landed.

Recovering those facts by re-parsing the English header prose with regexes on the
frontend pins nothing between the two sides, so a reword of the prose here breaks
card rendering silently and with no failing test. These helpers stamp the same
facts as a structured dict on the injected message's
``meta[SUBAGENT_COMPLETION_META_KEY]`` at composition time; the frontend reads
that first and keeps the regexes only as a legacy fallback.

The dict shape mirrors ``ParsedSingleCompletion`` / ``ParsedBatchCompletion`` in
``website/src/pages/chat/subagentCompletion.ts`` (minus ``body``, which the
frontend still derives from the message's blank-line split — a structural
boundary, not prose). Keep the two in lockstep.

Leaf module: imports only ``constants`` so any layer — the core ``subagent.py``
recovery paths and the dashboard gateway alike — can build the meta without a
dependency cycle.

    can fold it into the payload without re-reading the header line. Empty on the
    ordinary completion path, where the status word is redundant with the chip.

    callers); ``resolved_model`` is the model the session

    absent-equivalent when a provider cannot report a model.
