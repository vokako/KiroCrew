"""Client-side gateway port resolution — a deliberately light leaf module.

Home of the resolution chain every *client* of a running gateway uses to find
the port it should talk to: the CLI client commands (``token`` / ``status`` /
``logout`` / ``stop``) and the MCP stdio server's gateway callbacks. Both kinds
of consumer import this module at module scope; :mod:`kiro_crew.cli_server`
re-exports every name so its public surface (and the many tests that patch
these symbols there) is unchanged.

Leanness is this module's contract, not an accident: the MCP stdio server is
spawned once per CLI session and must not pay for ``cli_server``'s import graph
(frontend build, service controllers, preflight, embeddings) just to learn a
port number. Every import below is either stdlib or a module the MCP server
already loads at startup. A regression test asserts that importing this module
does not pull in ``kiro_crew.cli_server``.

Patch-namespace contract
------------------------

A large body of tests patches these symbols in the ``cli_server`` namespace
(``kiro_crew.cli_server._gateway_owns_port`` and friends). Chain-internal
calls therefore resolve their callee through :func:`_patchable`, which
prefers the ``cli_server`` namespace whenever that module is loaded and falls
back to this module otherwise. In production the two namespaces hold the very
same function objects (``cli_server`` re-exports them), so the lookup is
behaviour-neutral; under test it is what lets a patch in the ``cli_server``
namespace intercept a call made from inside the chain. The flip side: patch
``cli_server.<name>``, not this module's namespace — patching a name here
does NOT intercept chain-internal calls while ``cli_server`` is loaded, and
in a test process it almost always is.

    Reachability is not enough to trust a discovered port. Client commands hand
    the local secret to whatever answers (``_token`` and ``_logout`` send
    ``X-Local-Secret``), and ``clear_marker`` runs only on graceful shutdown —
    so a crashed gateway leaves a marker naming a port some unrelated process
    may since have bound. A bare TCP connect would walk the secret straight into
    that process, which could then mint owner tokens against the real gateway.

    A command-line check is not enough either: argv is attacker-chosen, so a
    listener launched as ``/tmp/kirocrew gateway`` would pass it. The proof used
    here is an identity the attacker cannot forge, in three parts:

    1. **Recorded pid** — ``run_marker.read_pid(port)`` reads the sidecar the
       gateway wrote at ``0600`` inside the ``0700`` ``run/`` dir. Another local
       user cannot write it, so they cannot nominate a process of theirs.
    2. **Holds the port** — that pid must be among
       ``platform_compat.find_listening_pids(port)``. This is what makes a stale
       recorded pid harmless: it has to actually hold the port we are about to
       send the secret to.
    3. **Owned by us, and ours** — the pid's uid must equal the caller's
       (``process_owner_uid``), and its argv must look like a gateway. The uid
       check is what closes pid *recycling* into a foreign user's process; argv
       remains only as defense in depth, never as the sole proof.

    A same-user attacker is out of scope by construction: they can already read
    ``.local_secret`` (mode ``0600``, their own uid), so nothing here can be an
    escalation for them. The boundary this closes is a *different* local user.

    **Fails closed** at every step: no sidecar, no recorded pid, a pid that does
    not hold the port, an unresolvable uid, a missing lookup tool
    (``find_listening_pids`` folds that into an empty list) or a throwing one —
    all deny, and discovery is skipped in favour of the documented default.
    ``--port`` and ``KIROCREW_PORT`` remain available on such hosts.

    **Non-POSIX denies outright.** ``process_owner_uid`` cannot report an owner
    on Windows, and a home that is writable by another user (a shared or
    misconfigured ``KIROCREW_HOME``) would let them replace both the marker and
    the sidecar with a forged listener — the file-permission argument that
    carries step 1 is exactly what stops holding there. Rather than trust
    steps 1-2 alone, discovery is skipped: Windows users keep ``--port`` /
    ``KIROCREW_PORT``, which is precisely where they were before this fallback
    existed, so nothing regresses. This is the one place the feature is
    deliberately unavailable rather than approximated.

    3. ``KIROCREW_BOUND_PORT`` env var if set to a valid integer — the port the

    nothing was configured at all but a gateway is up on a non-default port
    (e.g. started with ``kirocrew gateway --port 6776``): the parent's own
