_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """\
You are generating personalized feature tips for a developer assistant called Kiro Crew.

Based on the user context and the feature catalog below, generate {max_tips} tips \
for features the user would benefit from but may not know about.

IMPORTANT guidance:
1. Read the provided user context and recent memory carefully.
2. PREFER tips that are RELEVANT to what the user has been doing recently — if they \
work with cron jobs daily, tip about cron features first.
3. BUT note some features are context-independent (theme, split view, keyboard shortcuts) \
and may be suggested regardless of recent activity.

TONE — this is the most important rule. The reader is a developer mid-task; write \
like the product documentation, not like marketing:
- State plainly what the feature does and when it is useful. Nothing else.
- NO superlatives or hype ("powerful", "amazing", "supercharge", "game-changing", \
"effortlessly", "unlock", "transform", "revolutionize").
- NO exclamation marks. NO emoji. NO rhetorical questions ("Did you know...?", \
"Tired of...?").
- Do not oversell outcomes. "Runs independent tasks in parallel" is right; \
"Get results 10x faster" is wrong.
- Model the register on these real doc one-liners:
  "Schedule recurring tasks — 'every weekday at 9am give me a pipeline briefing'"
  "Spawn parallel background workers for fan-out research and multi-package work"
  "Persistent preferences, project context, and learned corrections across sessions"

ACTION — every tip must be immediately usable. Many Kiro Crew features are \
triggered by a keyboard shortcut or a Settings/config toggle, NOT by chatting; \
when so, name the EXACT key, Settings path, or config command in the body so the \
reader can act without opening docs. If the feature is invoked by asking the \
agent, put a ready-to-send message in cta_prompt.

Each tip must have:
- id: a short kebab-case identifier (e.g. "cron-scheduling-tip")
- title: the feature's plain name or its core action, under 60 chars \
(e.g. "Schedule recurring reports", not "Never miss a beat with cron!")
- feature: the feature name from the catalog
- body: 1-2 sentences; state what it does, then END with the exact action to \
take — a keyboard shortcut (e.g. press Cmd+K), a Settings path (e.g. \
Settings > Display > Interface), a config command (e.g. \
`kirocrew config set session.pool_size 2`), or a ready-to-send message
- why: 1 factual sentence connecting it to THIS user's actual recent workflow \
(name the specific activity; if the connection is weak, pick a different feature \
rather than inventing one)
- doc: the doc filename from the catalog
- cta_prompt: a ready-to-send chat message demonstrating the feature

Feature catalog:
---
{catalog}
---

User context:
---
{context}
---

Previously shown tip IDs (avoid repeating): {shown_ids}
Dismissed tip IDs (never suggest): {dismissed_ids}

Respond with ONLY a JSON array. No explanation, no markdown fences.

    resolve through a colliding id to the OLD pool's doc, and
    ``api_tips_feedback`` then records that doc in ``dismissed_docs`` — a
