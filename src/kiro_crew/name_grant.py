"""Whether a NAME-based approval may be honoured for a shell command line.

Every auto-approve tier that decides from a program NAME -- a session-trusted
pattern (``head *``), a configured ``auto_approve_tools`` glob, the read-only
allowlist -- is making a statement about a PROGRAM. The shell then performs its
own ``PATH`` lookup, and a gateway's ``PATH`` legitimately leads with
directories the agent itself can write (a worktree venv's ``bin``, mise shims,
``~/.local/bin``). A file the agent planted at ``~/.local/bin/head`` therefore
wins the lookup over ``/usr/bin/head``, and a grant made because the command
"is just ``head``" runs it.

:func:`name_grant_refusal` answers the one question those tiers need: does the
name still identify the program it appears to name? A refusal does NOT block the
command and does NOT rewrite it -- the request falls through to the ordinary
interactive approval card, where the human decides on this specific command.
That is the whole point: the tier's job is to skip a prompt the user has already
answered in general, and a shadowed name is a case the user has not answered.

Three shapes are refused, and nothing else:

* **A shadowing resolution.** The name resolves somewhere other than the
  same-named program in the trusted system directories
  (:func:`platform_compat.trusted_system_bin`). ``head`` found at
  ``~/.local/bin/head`` while ``/usr/bin/head`` exists is the reported attack.
* **A resolution inside a tree the agent writes** -- the project checkout, the
  LLM workspace root (:func:`github_runner.agent_writable_roots`), or a
  project-local tool directory (``.venv/bin``, ``node_modules/.bin``). No
  shadowing is needed for this one to be suspicious: it is the same class
  ``github_runner.validate_provider_executable`` and the terminal panel's
  command probe already refuse.
* **A name no approval has identified.** The two rules above cannot help a name
  the system directories do not carry -- ``gh``, ``node``, ``kirocrew``, a
  version manager's ``python`` -- because such a program legitimately lives
  where the user installed it, which is also where the agent can write. For
  those the tiers require a WITNESS: a human answering an approval card has seen
  the command and said yes, and that moment records the file's identity
  (:func:`pin_human_approval`). A grant naming the program is then honoured only
  while the same file answers to the name. No pin means refuse -- pinning on
  first SIGHT would bless whatever is there the first time a tier looks, and a
  tier looks precisely when it is about to auto-approve without asking anyone.

A command carrying a construct whose programs cannot be enumerated -- a
substitution inside quotes, a backtick, a process substitution -- is refused
whole, and so is a program token the shell expands (``$CMD``). Seeing part of a
command's program set is not a basis for vouching for the command.

What this deliberately does NOT do, stated plainly so the boundary is not
mistaken for a stronger one:

* It does not make a decision BINDING on the exec. The check runs when the
  approval is decided and the shell resolves again when it runs, so a second
  agent writing the shim in that window still wins. Closing that needs the
  child's ``PATH`` to stop leading with agent-writable directories, which
  changes the execution environment of every command the agent runs and is a
  separate change with its own compatibility surface.
* It does not decide that a user-owned directory is untrustworthy. A program
  the user installed into ``~/.local/bin`` is theirs, and refusing it outright
  would leave the auto-approve tiers dead on the most common developer host --
  an unused code path, not a security win. It is admitted on a human's say-so
  and only while it stays the same file, which costs one approval card per
  program (and one more after an upgrade) rather than the whole tier.
* It says nothing about full-trust or YOLO mode, which approve everything by
  construction and are not name-based grants.
* The witness is recorded on the dashboard's approval card. Another surface's
  approval does not pin, so a non-system program there keeps prompting -- more
  prompts, never fewer, which is the safe direction to be incomplete in.

Resolution runs against the same ``PATH`` value the spawn code hands the
child (:func:`env.augmented_path`), not this process's own ``PATH``: the child's
is a superset with the version-manager directories PREPENDED, so resolving
against ours would answer for a search order the command will not use.

Cost is a ``which`` walk plus a handful of ``stat`` calls per decision, on the
same order as ``trusted_system_bin``'s own lookup. The filesystem work runs on
a worker thread via :func:`refusal_for_command_off_loop` — never on the event
loop where the approval is decided; only the constant Windows decline is
answered on-loop, because it needs no filesystem access at all. Building the
search path is cheap wherever it runs because :func:`env.augmented_path` is
string work over a glob that ``env._node_all_bin_dirs`` caches for the process
lifetime, and that cache is already warm: the same call builds the ``PATH``
handed to the agent process at session start, long before any tool approval.

The verdict itself is deliberately uncached: a cached "trusted" answer is a
substitution window, and this must reflect the filesystem as it is when the tier
decides.

    what crashes an xdist worker rather than merely failing its test.

    An empty command answers ``None`` — the same deliberate contract as
    :func:`name_grant_refusal`: there is no name to vouch for, and every tier
