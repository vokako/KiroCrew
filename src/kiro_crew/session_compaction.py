"""Context-compaction policy and execution for :mod:`kiro_crew.session`.

The coordinator deliberately depends on a small owner facade instead of
importing ``kiro_crew.session``.  Session allocation and teardown still own the
registry, its lock, and the exact-identity ``_recycling`` marker; compaction
borrows those seams without becoming a second session manager.

Calls between formerly patchable ``SessionManager`` methods go back through
the owner.  Besides preserving the public/private monkeypatch surface during
the extraction, that keeps one authoritative place for lifecycle operations
such as guarded reset and queue retirement.
