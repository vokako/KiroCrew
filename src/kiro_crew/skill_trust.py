"""Per-directory consent for loading a project's own ``.kiro/skills``.

A ``SKILL.md`` is prose, not code, but it enters the agent's context and can
instruct the agent to run anything. Loading one out of whatever repository the
operator happens to open is therefore an execution-adjacent decision: a cloned
repository could ship instructions the operator never read. This module is the
consent record that gates it.

Trust is keyed on the **canonical** project directory (``os.path.realpath``),
because the directory *is* the resource. Keying on any softer identity -- a
display name, a slug, an index entry -- leaves the unkeyed component forgeable:
a second name aliasing one directory would grant itself separate trust, and a
rename would orphan the record.

Storage is ``<data home>/trust/project-skills.json``. That directory is already
a whole-directory entry on the keystone deny list, so the agent's own file tools
can neither read nor write this store; like every other keystone reader, this
module opens the path directly rather than through the agent file gate.

The gate fails **closed** everywhere: an unreadable store, a malformed store, or
an unreadable config all yield "nothing is trusted" rather than a permissive
default. Refusing to load a skill costs the operator a click; loading one they
did not consent to cannot be undone.

    A grant is consent for the CONTENT the operator reviewed, but a path is a

    the same canonical path -- a routine move on a shared dev host, and the normal
    life of a CI checkout directory -- and a path-only grant is inherited by
    content nobody reviewed, whose ``SKILL.md`` then enters the agent context with
    instruction authority the operator never gave it. Binding an identity the new
    directory cannot forge turns that silent inheritance into a consent re-prompt.

    ``st_dev``/``st_ino`` name the directory INSTANCE rather than its name.
    ``st_birthtime`` is folded in where the platform exposes it (macOS, the BSDs,
    Windows) because an inode number can itself be reused after a delete, which is
    the very case being closed; on Linux, where CPython does not expose a birth
    time, ``dev:ino`` alone still discriminates every recreate that lands on a
    different inode -- which a fresh clone and a moved tree both do.

    Deliberately NOT a content fingerprint of the ``.kiro/skills`` tree, and
    deliberately not ``st_ctime``: both change when the operator edits their own
    skills, so either would re-prompt on ordinary work instead of on a
    substitution, and a consent prompt that fires routinely is one that gets
    clicked through.

    Two residuals, stated rather than implied closed, both specific to a platform
    that exposes no birth time (Linux, where ``dev:ino`` stands alone):

    * The ACCIDENTAL case -- a different repository at a path the operator happens
      to have granted -- is fully closed, because a fresh clone or a moved tree
      lands on a different inode. The ADVERSARIAL case is closed only
      best-effort: a local actor who can already write that path can grind
      create/delete until the filesystem reuses the inode. Narrowing that needs a
      real birth time (``statx`` ``STATX_BTIME``), which CPython does not surface
      on Linux today; folding it in when it does is the fix.
    * ``st_dev`` is not stable across remounts on btrfs subvolumes, NFS, and some
      container bind mounts, so a bound grant can stop matching after a reboot
      with the content unchanged. That direction is fail-closed -- the operator is
      re-asked, never over-trusted -- but it is a re-prompt they did not earn, and
      so the same habituation risk this docstring rejects a content fingerprint
      for. If it shows up in practice the answer is to compare the inode plus a
      content-independent tie-break, not to relax the check.
