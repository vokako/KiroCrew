"""Quick prompts — slash tokens that expand into an instruction the agent reads.

A quick prompt is a MACRO, not a command. The user types ``/plain``; the agent
receives the written-out instruction that token stands for. Nothing is executed,
no session state changes, and no surface has to know the token exists.

Two properties are the reason this module sits in the core rather than in the
dashboard:

* Expansion happens inside :meth:`kiro_crew.context.ContextBuilder.build_message`,
  the one function every inbound surface funnels through, so one row reaches every
  surface at once instead of needing a branch per dispatcher. The dashboard-only
  text rewrites (``$skill`` append, ``@prompt`` replacement, both in
  ``dashboard/chat_runner.py``) are deliberately NOT the model copied here — each
  of them buys one surface.
* The expansion is what the MODEL sees, not what is stored. The row persisted to
  history and echoed back into the transcript is still the ``/plain`` the user
  typed, so the scrollback stays readable and a replay does not re-run a wall of
  instructions.

Where a token actually ARRIVES is narrower than "every surface", and worth stating
precisely because the limit is not ours to fix from here. Expansion is reached
whenever the leading token survives to the gateway as message TEXT: the dashboard
composer, Telegram (an unknown ``/word`` is delivered to the bot), and every
non-client surface — a cron turn, a subagent, the task runner. Two clients capture
a leading ``/`` BEFORE the gateway is involved, and no backend placement changes
that:

* **Slack** reads a leading ``/`` as a workspace slash command. An unregistered
  token yields Slack's own "not a valid command" notice and the message is never
  posted, so nothing reaches ``build_message``.
* **Discord** routes a leading ``/`` into its native slash-command UI, which is why
  this product's own Discord aliases are documented as ``!``-prefixed.

Adding the next quick prompt is one row in :data:`QUICK_PROMPTS` plus one
description key in the composer menu. It is never a new code path.

A quick-prompt token must NOT collide with a command some surface parses AHEAD of
the funnel — ``_SLASH_COMMANDS`` in ``dashboard/chat_utils.py``, or a channel's own
alias set in ``<channel>/commands.py``. A colliding token would be handled by that
surface and never expand: per-surface drift, the exact thing this layer exists to
end. A test unions every one of those sets and pins the disjointness.

# Shared by every row: the shape of the answer, as distinct from its subject.

# names over analogies, a decision at the end — is the product itself and must not
# drift per row.
_STYLE_CONTRACT = """
FORMAT. Answer in 3 to 5 LINES, one thought per line, each on its own line with a
blank line between them. Not one paragraph: the line breaks ARE the structure, and a
single block of prose is the failure this format exists to prevent. Five lines is a
ceiling, not a target — if three say it, stop at three.

Keep every line short enough to take in at a glance: about one sentence, never more
than roughly thirty words. A line needing a semicolon and two clauses is either two
lines or a line to cut. No headers, no bold labels, no bullet markers, no preamble,
no restating the question back.

LANGUAGE AND REGISTER. Write in the language the reader is using in this
conversation, and in the register they write in — if they have been writing Chinese,
answer in Chinese. Follow their stated preferences and the corrections they have
taught you: how terse they want it, which vocabulary they use, what they have told
you never to do. Those win over anything here, which governs shape, not voice.

Ground every claim in the real thing — the actual identifiers, file paths with
line numbers, PR and issue numbers, and command output you have seen in this
session — and use this project's own vocabulary for them. Do not reach for an
analogy or a metaphor: the reader already knows the domain and needs the real names
to act on.

Where you are unsure, say so plainly instead of smoothing it over, and name the
one thing that would settle it.

The LAST line is the decision now in front of the reader: two named options, or the
single next step when nothing actually needs deciding. Label it in the reader's own
language (in English, "Decision: A or B").

Add a diagram only when the situation is genuinely structural: parallel branches,
a state machine, an ordering that turned out to matter. Then put one small
diagram after the lines. A straightforward status gets no diagram.

If the reader replies that they still do not follow, do NOT make the next answer
longer. Cut it differently: drop to a single concrete example, or narrow the
scope to the one part that matters.
