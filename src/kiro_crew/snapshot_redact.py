"""Neutralise credential material in a bundle that is about to leave the host.

An off-host copy crosses a trust boundary the local archive does not: it lands in object
storage, and every principal that can read the bucket can read it. This module rewrites a
STAGED COPY of a bundle so the bytes that leave carry no usable credentials, and it is the
only place in the backup path that does so.

**It is lossy on purpose, and the loss is the point.** A redacted bundle restores to a
working shape but not to a working credential: the token field is present and inert, so the
operator re-enters it rather than discovering an empty file. That tradeoff is a deliberate
product decision, and `backup.redact_uploads` exists to reverse it for an operator who
would rather have a bundle that restores complete.

Two properties make the difference between a redacted bundle and a broken one:

* **Structure survives.** The redactors substitute a tag for a match, so they CHANGE
  LENGTH. Running them over the bytes of a SQLite file does not produce a database with
  dead credentials, it produces a file SQLite cannot open — which the restore path then
  correctly refuses as corrupt. Databases are therefore redacted through SQL, value by
  value, so what is written back is still a database.
* **The bundle says so.** The manifest records that this copy was redacted and what was
  touched, so a restore can tell the operator their credentials are inert instead of
  letting them find out when something fails to authenticate.

    A `UnicodeDecodeError` is the answer to "is this text", not a failure: the caller
    refuses the upload for those rather than removing the file.

    Decoding is necessary evidence of text and not sufficient. NUL is a legal code point,
    so a NUL-padded binary whose other bytes are ASCII decodes cleanly -- a tar of text
    files is exactly that shape. Replacing a credential is a VARIABLE-LENGTH edit, so
    rewriting such a file moves every following byte and the structure is destroyed; the
    operator restores a file that is no longer a valid archive.

    Gated on `hits` rather than on NUL alone, because the hazard lives only on the branch
    that WRITES. A NUL-bearing file with no credential in it is never rewritten, so it is
    handed over byte-for-byte and refusing it would cost an upload for a corruption that
    cannot occur. What is refused is the pair: content this pass would have to rewrite,
    in a file it cannot rewrite safely.

    The NUL test alone does not cover every offset-dependent container, and what is left was
    MEASURED rather than reasoned about: of ZIP, gzip, PNG, tar and a Flate-stream PDF, all
    five are already refused here, each being either not UTF-8 or NUL-bearing.

    That measurement was then over-read. It established which BINARY containers reach this
    branch and was written up as naming the one shape that does -- an uncompressed ASCII PDF.
    Review supplied the counterexample: a text WARC is UTF-8, NUL-free, and declares
    `Content-Length` for every record, so a variable-length edit leaves each length stale and
    every later record unreadable. Measuring one family and generalising to all of them is
    the same error this branch keeps making.

    So the test is the MECHANISM, not the format: a text file that declares its own extents
    internally cannot survive a variable-length rewrite, whatever it is called. `startxref`
    covers PDF's cross-reference offsets (keyed on the mechanism rather than on `%PDF-`), and
    `Content-Length` covers WARC, HTTP archives, MIME multipart and mbox in one rule. That is
    a list of ways to declare an extent rather than a list of file types, which is what makes
    it stop growing per format.

    Residual, stated rather than implied: a container that declares extents in some other
    spelling is still rewritten. The cost of the rule is also real and accepted -- an HTTP
    debug log that contains both a credential and `Content-Length` headers is refused rather
    than cleaned, because its structure cannot be told from a real archive's here, and
    refusing an upload is recoverable while corrupting one is not.

    """Refuse a database whose UPDATE triggers DELETE rows.

    The fixpoint scan below handles one thing a trigger does, and does it provably: copy a
    pre-update value somewhere the pass has already been, which the next pass then cleans.
    It cannot handle the other thing. A trigger that DELETES runs once, settles immediately,
    and the fixpoint sees a quiet database -- the rows are simply gone from the copy that
    leaves. Reproduced: an `AFTER UPDATE` trigger removed both rows of an unrelated table
    while the pass reported success.

    Scoped to DELETE deliberately, and NARROWER than the prescription that produced it.
    Review asked for every non-FTS UPDATE trigger to be refused; that would throw away the
    fixpoint, which is a deliberate, tested capability for exactly the copy-the-value case --
    and it would refuse the product's own external-content full-text index, which is
    MAINTAINED by update triggers. A trigger that only writes values is the schema doing
    what it says, and any credential it propagates is what the fixpoint is for.

    An FTS-maintenance trigger is exempt only for the deletions that ARE that maintenance:
    every `DELETE FROM` in its body must target FTS storage. The first version of this
    exempted the whole trigger as soon as any FTS name appeared anywhere in it, so a trigger
    that maintains the index AND deletes unrelated rows was waved through -- review's
    finding, and the same mistake this refusal exists to correct: a rule justified for one of
    a thing's statements, applied to all of them.

    The residual, stated rather than implied: `INSERT OR REPLACE` and `REPLACE INTO`
    are refused rather than left uncaught -- they
    are spellings a body either contains or does not, so text bounds them honestly. An
    `UPDATE` aimed at a table OTHER than the trigger's own is refused for the same reason:
    it overwrites rows this pass is not rewriting, so their prior values are gone from the
    copy that leaves, and the fixpoint can observe a settled database but never restore them.

    What genuinely remains: an `UPDATE` on the trigger's OWN table with no row bound can
    still overwrite other rows of that table. It stays allowed because the shape it cannot be
    told apart from by text -- a mirror column maintained by
    `UPDATE t SET mirror = NEW.body WHERE id = NEW.id` -- is ordinary, and the fixpoint
    provably cleans it. Separating those two needs the statement's effects.

    That is why the refusal keys on the TARGET rather than on the body containing an `UPDATE`
    at all. Both broader rules were measured and rejected: refusing every non-FTS
    UPDATE-writing trigger discards the fixpoint entirely (three tests in this suite assert
    the value-writing cases it handles -- a trigger propagating a credential is CLEANED by
    the next pass, not shipped) and refuses the product's own external-content index, whose
    maintenance is exactly such a trigger; refusing every body containing an `UPDATE` then
    fails the mirror-column case above. The trade is deliberate: cleaning a propagated value
    serves the operator, refusing to back up at all does not.
