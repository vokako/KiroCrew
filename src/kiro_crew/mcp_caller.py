"""Caller-identity protocol extension for KiroCrew MCP servers.

BACKGROUND
----------
The base MCP protocol (Anthropic spec 2024-11-05) models a 1:1 stdio
transport: one client, one server. When KiroCrew introduces a broker that
fans N client sessions into a shared backend, the backend no
longer has an implicit 1:1 identity — it needs to know *which* client made
each call so it can:

* Route callbacks back to the originating session (``spawn_run`` completion,
  ``register_hook``, ``send_message(session='origin')``).
* Scope per-session state (memory keys, file paths, audit records).
* Enforce per-session authorization policies.

A ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` environment variable baked in at spawn time cannot
carry this identity under pooling: one backend serves many sessions but sees
only the first session's env var.

DESIGN
------
This module defines a **namespaced, versioned, typed** protocol extension:

1. **Wire format** — the gateway injects identity into every forwarded
   ``tools/call`` request under a namespaced ``_meta`` key::

       "_meta": {
           "kirocrew.caller": {
               "schemaVersion": 1,
               "sessionKey": "T123ABC:C456DEF:1777...",
               "sessionType": "slack-thread" | "dashboard" | "cron" | ...,
               "principalId": "alice",
               "channelId": "C0AUNEY55NV"
           }
       }

2. **Capability negotiation** — backends that support pooled operation
   advertise the extension in their ``initialize`` response::

       "capabilities": {
           "tools": {"listChanged": false},
           "experimental": {
               "kirocrew.caller-identity": {"schemaVersion": 1}
           }
       }

   Gatewayd inspects this capability at backend boot and uses it to decide
   whether to INJECT the caller block. It does NOT decide pooling: a backend
   that never advertises is pooled all the same, and simply never receives an
   identity -- pooled and identity-blind, which is worse than either alone.
   The "refuse to pool an unadvertised backend" behaviour described in earlier
   revisions of this docstring was never implemented; ``rewriter.py`` records
   the same fact next to ``UNPOOLABLE_SERVERS``, which is empty and remains the
   only mechanism of its kind. A backend that cannot consume the block must be
   listed there.

3. **Typed context** — tool handlers receive a ``CallerContext`` dataclass
   as an explicit argument. No contextvars, no env reads, no implicit state.
   When the gateway does not inject the extension (non-pooled topology,
   older gateway, legacy clients), a fallback ``CallerContext`` is
   constructed from the ambient ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` env var so
   existing behaviour is preserved.

4. **Forward compatibility** — ``schemaVersion`` lets the extension evolve.
   A v2 schema may add fields; v1 consumers must ignore unknown keys.

This module is the **single source of truth** for the extension's wire
format, capability name, and validation rules. mcp_core / mcp_cron and
any future KiroCrew-owned MCP server must go through this module.

# --- Protocol identifiers ---------------------------------------------------

#: Namespaced key placed inside ``params._meta`` on forwarded tools/call.
CALLER_META_KEY = "kirocrew.caller"

#: Capability key backends advertise in ``initialize`` response under
#: ``capabilities.experimental``. Presence indicates the backend
#: understands the ``kirocrew.caller`` ``_meta`` block and is safe to pool.
CALLER_CAPABILITY_KEY = "kirocrew.caller-identity"

#: Current schema version of the caller identity block. Bump when fields
#: change in a non-additive way. Additive changes (new optional fields) do
#: NOT bump this version — consumers MUST ignore unknown fields.
CALLER_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1

#: Namespaced key placed inside ``params._meta`` carrying a per-CONNECTION
#: nonce, on every forwarded request — including the ones the gateway cannot
#: attach an identity to.
#:
#: This is deliberately NOT part of the caller block, and the distinction is the
#: whole point: the caller block is an IDENTITY (who is calling, used for
#: routing callbacks and for authorization), while this is only a SEPARATOR (two
#: calls carrying different nonces came from different stub connections). A
#: backend that needs distinct per-tenant state for callers the gateway could
#: not name must key that state on the nonce; it must never present the nonce as
#: attribution, and no identity resolver reads it.
#:
#: Why a nonce is needed at all: a backend serving an unnamed caller falls back
#: to a per-PROCESS namespace, which separates sessions exactly as far as the
#: 1:1 shim topology makes them separate processes. On a POOLED backend one
#: process serves N connections, so that fallback collapses every unnamed
#: co-tenant onto one namespace.
TENANT_META_KEY = "kirocrew.tenant"

#: Schema version of the tenant block. Same additive rule as the caller block.
TENANT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1

#: Bytes of entropy in a minted nonce. It is a namespace separator, not a
#: capability, so this only has to make an accidental collision impossible;
#: 64 bits does that for any number of connections a gateway will ever hold.
_TENANT_NONCE_BYTES = 8

#: Process-lifetime cache of a RESOLVED ``from_env()`` identity. The env var
#: and ancestor pidfile chain are immutable once present, so the walk need run
#: at most once. The walk does not fork ``ps`` per ancestor (``_parent_pid``
#: delegates to ``platform_compat.get_ppid``), but it is still a chain of file
#: reads or syscalls on a hot path. Only a non-empty result is cached, so a
#: warm-pool session claimed after the first call can still resolve once its
#: pidfile appears (see ``from_env``).
_FROM_ENV_CACHE: "CallerContext | None" = None

    """Best-effort parent-PID lookup. Returns 0 on failure so an ancestor walk
    terminates safely.

    Delegates to :func:`kiro_crew.platform_compat.get_ppid`, which reads
    ``/proc/<pid>/status`` on Linux, ``libproc.proc_pidinfo`` on macOS and
    ``CreateToolhelp32Snapshot`` on Windows -- none of which spawns a process.

    Avoiding a ``ps`` fork per ancestor matters here: this walk runs on the
    stub's Register path (bounded at ten levels) and on every iteration of the
    recaller poll, whose backoff caps at 30s but does not terminate while the
    session key is unresolved -- and an unresolved key is exactly the condition
    that starts the poll, so it cannot be served from the non-empty-only cache.
    ``get_ppid`` also resolves on Windows, where ``ps`` does not exist.

    ``get_ppid`` reports failure as ``-1``; normalise it to ``0`` so the walk
    loops (``while pid > 1``) and the callers' guards behave correctly.
