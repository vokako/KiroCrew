# Feature Map

One table per area, mapping every user-facing dashboard feature to **how a user
reaches it** and **where its code lives**. It exists so that "which page and
which handler own this?" is a lookup rather than a search, for a human or an
agent landing cold on a feature.

It is a **navigation index, not a contract**. Behavior contracts live in
[`../system-specs/`](../system-specs/README.md); this file says where to go and
deliberately says nothing about how a feature works.

## Maintenance contract

**A pull request that ADDS or REMOVES a feature updates this map in the same
PR. A pull request that only changes how an existing feature behaves does
not.** That line is drawn where it is because a map re-reviewed on every edit
stops being read: the cost has to land on the change that actually invalidates
a row.

`scripts/check_feature_map.py` enforces the mechanical half. It reads the
`base..HEAD` diff and fails only when a file is **added or deleted** under
`website/src/pages/` or `src/kiro_crew/dashboard/handlers/`, or a `<Route>`
entry is added or removed in `website/src/App.tsx`, while this file is
untouched. Editing existing files never trips it. The job row is in
[../ci/ci-and-reviews.md](../ci/ci-and-reviews.md).

The judgment half is reviewer-owned: the blocking `feature-map-correctness`
rule in root `AUTOSDE.yaml` verifies each changed row against the code diff and
rejects unrelated or cosmetic map churn. The mechanical check cannot tell
whether a row's *content* is still true, only that a structural change went by
without anyone looking at the map. When the check fires and the honest answer
is "no feature changed", update the row the new file belongs to so its columns
remain truthful; a whitespace or cosmetic edit does not count.

## How to read this

- **Reach it** is the user's path, written as the URL plus the tab or control
  that gets there. `?tab=` and `?view=` are real query parameters the page
  parses, not shorthand.
- **Page** is relative to `website/src/`.
- **Handler** is relative to `src/kiro_crew/dashboard/`. Two areas live outside
  that root and are written in full.
- **Endpoints** are 2–4 representative routes, not the complete set. The full
  table is `src/kiro_crew/dashboard/routes/` plus the direct registrations in
  `dashboard/server.py`; `test/test_dashboard_route_table.py` pins its order.
- `TODO(verify)` marks a cell nobody has confirmed against code. Fix it or
  leave it; never replace it with a guess.

Sidebar entries come from `website/src/surfaces/builtins.tsx`, which is the
authoritative nav table (label, group, badge, preview gate). A surface marked
`hiddenFromNav` there has a working route but no rail row — it is reached from
somewhere else, noted per row below.

## Chat and sessions

The default destination. `/chat` is the rail's **Sessions** row; everything in
this area is reached from inside it unless stated otherwise.

| Feature | What it is | Reach it | Page | Handler | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sessions | Multi-slot agent chat, one slot per conversation; pinned rows form a manually ordered section above automatic sorting | `/chat/:slug?` — rail **Sessions** | `pages/ChatPage.tsx`, `pages/ChatSidebar.tsx`, `pages/chat/SessionFlyout.tsx`, `pages/chat/TranscriptScrollShell.tsx` (internal split of ChatPage — the transcript scroller skeleton, no new user-facing feature), `pages/chat/ChatPageMessageContent.tsx` (internal split of ChatPage — the header menu, row-key helpers and user-bubble content renderers, no new user-facing feature), `pages/chat/useChatPageTranscriptController.tsx` (internal split of ChatPage — scroll-to-bottom, auto-follow gating, nav scrolling and the pinned-prompt banner, no new user-facing feature), `pages/chat/useChatPageSessionController.ts` (internal split of ChatPage — session identity, `?sid` URL sync, session tabs and slot auto-create, no new user-facing feature), `pages/chat/useChatPageResourcesController.tsx` (internal split of ChatPage — side-panel tabs, source/issue selection, file/folder/artifact/diff opening, uploads, screen snips and drops, no new user-facing feature), `pages/chat/hoverHold.ts` (internal split of ChatSidebar — seat arithmetic for the hovered-row hold, no new user-facing feature), `utils/pinnedSessionOrder.ts` | `chat_handlers.py`, `ws.py` | `POST /api/chat`, `GET,POST /api/chat/slots`, `GET /api/ws` |

| Collapse the message input | Puts the composer away while you read a long reply and hands the room to the transcript (measured 89px at 1500x950); a labelled bar stands in its place, reports the unsent draft’s first line, and restores it. Off by default, and the choice persists. Collapses the opposite end of the same reply from the **Pinned prompt banner** above | Composer **+** menu → **Collapse the message input**; on touch, the **⋯** overflow beside the attach button | `components/ChatInput.tsx` (opted in by `pages/ChatPage.tsx`; focus intents resolve through `pages/chat/composerFocus.ts`) | client-only (no handler) | none |

| Question cards | Agent asks a multiple-choice question in chat | Inline card in the transcript | `components/PendingQuestionCard.tsx` | `handlers/ask_question.py` | `POST /api/ask-question`, `GET /api/ask-question/pending`, `POST /api/ask-question/{ask_id}/answer` |
| Files in chat | Browse, attach and upload workspace files | Chat left rail → files; composer attach | `pages/chat/FileBrowserRail.tsx`, `pages/chat/FilesHomePanel.tsx` | `handlers/files.py` | `GET /api/file-read`, `POST /api/upload`, `POST /api/upload/file` |
| Terminal panel | Two shells on the gateway host: an app-wide docked PTY, and a per-chat terminal whose tab lives in that chat's panel state (opens on the chat's working dir; switches with the session) | Header terminal toggle (docked); chat right panel → **+** menu → **Terminal** (per-chat) | `components/BottomTerminalPanel.tsx`, `pages/chat/SidePanel.tsx` | `handlers/terminal.py` | `POST /api/terminal/sessions`, `GET /api/ws/terminal/{session_id}` |

| App-contributed panel tabs | Side-panel tabs an installed app declares in `contributes.panelTabs`; each mounts the app's own ESM bundle as the tab body through the in-process app host. Only enabled apps contribute, and no app means no rows | Chat right panel → **+** menu → the app's row; on an empty panel, its launcher card | `pages/chat/SidePanel.tsx`, `hooks/panelTabRegistry.ts`, `components/AppHost.tsx` | `src/kiro_crew/apps/routes.py` | `GET /api/apps`, `GET /apps/{name}/ui/{path}` |
| Notifications | Bell feed of agent-pushed notifications | Topbar bell → `/notifications` | `pages/NotificationsPage.tsx` | `handlers/messaging.py`, `handlers/notifications_push.py` | `GET /api/notifications`, `POST /api/notifications/ack`, `POST /api/notifications/push` |
| Crew Members | One durable pinned DM thread per crew member; the detail drawer lists the worker sessions the member is driving (live `slots` frames filtered on `created_by`) and the member's auto-patrol status — the nudge loop on its own `member-<slug>` slot (active / stopped with reason / none), with a roster avatar badge while a loop exists (accent while patrolling, warn once stopped); active patrols also list under Wake sources; the roster carries a per-crew star (persisted on the crew record) and persistent filters — starred-only and origin (mine / built-in / from packages) — so the package-installed crews the agent sync writes can be collapsed | `/members` — rail row when the crew preview is on; the open member rides `?member=<name>` (a bare `/members` opens the remembered member, else the first row; below md it stays the roster) | `pages/members/MembersPage.tsx`, `components/autoNudgeLoop.ts` (shared cycle/countdown readouts) | `handlers/members.py`, `handlers/agents.py` (`starred`), `slot_projection.py` (`created_by`), `handlers/autonudge.py` (registry read) | `GET /api/members`, `POST /api/members/{slug}/thread`, `GET /api/members/{slug}/activity`, `GET,PUT /api/members/{slug}/rules`, `PUT /api/agents/{name}` (`starred`), `GET /api/autonudge`, `GET /api/ws` (`slots`, `autonudge_state`) |
| Channels | Group rooms with several agents in one thread | `/channels` (builtin app surface) | `pages/ChannelPage.tsx` | `handlers_channel.py` | `GET,POST /api/channels`, `POST /api/channels/{id}/messages`, `POST /api/channels/{id}/agents` |

The Notifications surface is registered `hiddenFromNav`: its route and badge
stay wired, but it is entered from the topbar bell rather than a rail row.

## Agent Capabilities

One destination, pinned to the bottom of the rail, hosting nine tabs. Every tab
is a `?tab=` value on `/capabilities` (`pages/CapabilitiesPage.tsx`).

Any one of those tabs can also be **promoted to its own top-level rail row**, so
a sub-item someone uses daily is one click away instead of two. Each tab is
registered as a `pinnable` surface (`surfaces/builtins.tsx`,
`surfaces/registry.ts`), which keeps it OFF the rail until the user promotes it;
the promoted set is a per-browser preference held under `mc-nav-pinned` and
owned by `lib/navPinned.ts` (the sibling of `lib/appNavHidden.ts`, which does
the same job for app rows in the Apps group). Reach it from the pin control in
the Agent Capabilities page header (`components/PinSurfaceButton.tsx`), which
resolves its subject from the current `?tab=` value. Promotions are capped at
`NAV_PINNED_LIMIT`, and the rail applies the filter in `App.tsx`. No handler and
no endpoint: the preference never leaves the browser.

| Tab | What it is | Reach it | Page | Handler | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Crews | Named agent bindings — which agent, model and workspace; per-crew custom avatar (hand-picked ghost traits or an uploaded picture, edited in the crew editor's avatar builder) | `/capabilities?tab=crews` | `pages/KiroCrewAgentsPage.tsx`, `components/CrewAvatarBuilder.tsx`, `components/CrewAvatar.tsx` | `handlers/agents.py` | `GET /api/agent/config`, `GET,PUT /api/config/default-agent`, `POST /api/agents`, `PUT,DELETE /api/agents/{name}`, `GET,POST /api/agents/{name}/avatar` |

`/agents`, `/mc-agents` and `/connections` are legacy paths that redirect here;
`/knowledge` redirects to `?tab=knowledge`. `/hooks` also stands alone as a
full page.

## Memory, lessons and usage

Not a rail destination. The user-facing memory browser is a drill-in under
Settings → Overview; the graph visualizer is a Developer internals view.

| Feature | What it is | Reach it | Page | Handler | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Memory browser | Preferences, projects, history, lessons, vector store | `/settings/overview?view=memory` | `pages/overview/MemoryTab.tsx` | `handlers/memory.py`, `handlers/cron.py` | `GET,PUT /api/memory/preferences`, `GET /api/memory/semantic`, `GET,POST /api/lessons` |

| WakaTime coding activity and export | Coding stats for a named range plus project-grouped hours over a date range as a CSV or JSON download, for the productivity view and billable-hours invoicing | `/settings/overview?view=wakatime` | `pages/overview/WakaTimeTab.tsx` | `handlers/wakatime.py` | `GET /api/wakatime/stats`, `GET /api/wakatime/export` |
| Portability | Export and import the whole memory/config bundle | `/settings/imports` | `pages/overview/PortabilityTab.tsx` | `handlers/portability.py` | `GET /api/portability/export`, `POST /api/portability/import`, `POST /api/portability/preview` |

## Schedules and loops

| Feature | What it is | Reach it | Page | Handler | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Schedule | Cron jobs: recurring agent turns, scripts, commands | `/schedule` — rail **Schedule**; also created inline from the crew editor's "What wakes this crew" section (`/capabilities?tab=crews`) | `pages/SchedulePage.tsx`, `components/CrewWakeSection.tsx` | `handlers/cron.py` | `GET,POST /api/crons`, `DELETE /api/crons/{job_id}`, `GET /api/crons/history` |
| Cron secret grants | Owner-approved vault-secret env grants for script crons: agent requests via `cron_secret_request`, the owner approves/denies/revokes on the job's Secrets panel | `/schedule` → job → **Secrets** | `pages/SchedulePage.tsx` (`JobSecretsPanel`) | `handlers/cron.py` | `PUT /api/crons/{job_id}/secrets` |
| Monitor loops | Same-session bounded monitors and legacy nudge loops watching an external thing; a member's loop is also surfaced read-only on the Crew Members drawer | Chat composer → monitor popover; Crew Members → member drawer → Auto patrol; agent-armed | `components/SessionAutomationPopover.tsx`, `components/AutoNudgePopover.tsx`, `components/autoNudgeLoop.ts`, `pages/members/MembersPage.tsx` (read-only) | `handlers/autonudge.py` | `GET,POST /api/monitors`, `PATCH /api/monitors/{id}`, `GET /api/monitors/slot/{slot_key}`, `POST /api/monitors/{id}/stop`, `POST /api/monitors/{id}/restart`, `GET,POST /api/autonudge`, `PATCH,DELETE /api/autonudge/{loop_id}`, `POST /api/autonudge/{loop_id}/fire` |
| Session ledger | Durable per-session work state surviving compaction | Agent-written; no dashboard page | — | `handlers/session_ledger.py` | `GET /api/session-ledger`, `POST /api/session-ledger/record` |
| Work ledger | The shared record between a conductor session and the worker sessions it dispatched: a worker reports schema-bounded status against its own item, and its conductor reads that record plus the acceptance batch it decides from. Used by `kirocrew-ledger-conductor` and `kirocrew-worker` ALONE — `kirocrew-conductor` and `kirocrew-pipeline-conductor` deliberately do not mount `kirocrew-work`, so an existing conductor keeps the transcript-reading procedure it shipped with | Agent-written via the `kirocrew-work` MCP tools; no dashboard page yet (Phase 4 adds the Crew page item table) | — | `handlers/work_ledger.py` | `GET /api/work-ledger`, `POST /api/work-ledger/record`, `GET /api/work-ledger/brief`, `POST /api/work-ledger/report` |
| Session control | Create / stop / send-to a session from outside it | Agent and app callers, not a UI | — | `session_control.py` | `POST /api/session-control/create`, `.../stop`, `.../send`, `GET .../read` |

## Artifacts

| Feature | What it is | Reach it | Page | Handler | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| Publishing | Push an artifact out to a configured provider, then re-check a recorded notice | Artifact detail → share menu, plus the publication banner's "Check again" | `pages/ArtifactDetailPage.tsx`, `components/PublishHub.tsx` | `handlers/artifacts.py` | `GET /api/artifacts/publish-providers`, `POST /api/artifacts/{slug}/publish`, `DELETE .../publish`, `POST .../publish/refresh`, `POST .../publish/reprobe-notice`, `PATCH /api/artifacts/{slug}/sharing` |
| Deploy | Ship a webapp artifact to a public URL on the user's AWS | `/deploy` (`/artifacts/deploy` redirects) | `pages/ArtifactDeployPage.tsx` | `src/kiro_crew/deploy/handlers.py` | `GET,PUT /api/deploy/config`, `GET,POST /api/deploy/profiles`, `POST /api/deploy/deploy` |

## Apps

Third-party and builtin apps that add their own pages, crons and MCP tools.

| Feature | What it is | Reach it | Page | Handler | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Discover | Browse the app registries and install | `/apps` — **Apps** section header link | `pages/apps/DiscoverPage.tsx` | `src/kiro_crew/apps/routes.py` | `GET /api/apps/registry`, `POST /api/apps/registry/install`, `GET /api/apps/registries` |
| Updates | Apps with a newer version available | `/apps/-/updates` | `pages/apps/DiscoverPage.tsx`, `pages/apps/UpdatesList.tsx` | `src/kiro_crew/apps/routes.py` | `GET /api/apps`, `POST /api/apps/{name}/update` |
| Library | Installed apps, launchpad tiles, rail pinning | `/apps/library` | `pages/apps/LibraryPage.tsx` | `src/kiro_crew/apps/routes.py` | `GET /api/apps`, `POST /api/apps/{name}/enable`, `POST /api/apps/{name}/disable` |
| App detail | One app's manifest, config, permissions, uninstall | `/apps/detail/:name` | `pages/AppDetailPage.tsx` | `src/kiro_crew/apps/routes.py` | `GET /api/apps/{name}`, `GET /api/apps/{name}/manifest`, `GET /api/apps/{name}/config` |
| Installed app page | An app's own UI, served by the app | `/apps/:name` | `pages/AppPage.tsx` | app-owned | `POST /api/apps/{name}/token`, `POST /api/apps/{name}/open` |
| App migration | Move an app's data after a packaging change | `/apps/migrate/:name` | `pages/MigrationPage.tsx` | `src/kiro_crew/apps/routes.py` | `DELETE /api/apps/{name}/migrate-cleanup` |
| Builtin app surfaces | Top-level routes builtin apps claim | `/<app>` via the `/:builtinApp` catch-all | `apps/builtinRegistry.ts` → per-app page | per-app `backend/routes.py` | `POST /api/apps/<app>/...` per app |
| App session controls | A compact per-chat control an app contributes to the composer, handed the active session's identity | Chip in the composer bar of any chat, when an enabled app declares `contributes.sessionControls` — no route of its own | `hooks/useSessionControls.ts`, `components/SessionControlHost.tsx`, `components/ChatInput.tsx` (chips), `pages/ChatPage.tsx` (wiring) | `src/kiro_crew/apps/manifest.py` (declaration + validation); the status route is app-owned | `GET /api/apps`, `GET /api/apps/{name}/{statusPath}` (in-gateway) or `GET /apps/{name}/api/{statusPath}` (process-backed) |

`apps/builtinRegistry.ts` is the path→component table for builtin surfaces
(22 entries: Worlds, Channels, Auto Improvement, Auto Research, AWS Control,
File Explorer, Code Review Sage, Workflows, Dev Fleet, Issue Radar, Meetings,
Papyrus, PPTX Maker, Ops Mission Control, Design Critique, Crew Companion,
Task Runner, MD Notebook, Mochi, Spec Builder, Personal Shopper, Design Tweak).
Adding a builtin surface means an entry there plus `ui.pages` in the manifest —
`App.tsx` needs no change, which is why the router-delta half of the freshness
check cannot see it and the pages-dir half can.

## Task runner and subagents

| Feature | What it is | Reach it | Page | Handler | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Task Runner | Autonomous multi-step runs from a spec | `/projects` — **Apps** group rail row | `pages/ProjectsPage.tsx` | `handlers/taskrunner.py`, `handlers_project.py` | `GET,POST /api/projects`, `POST /api/taskrunner/plan`, `POST /api/taskrunner/from-chat` |
| Task detail | One run's steps, gates and approvals | `/projects` → a project row | `pages/ProjectDetailPage.tsx` | `handlers_project.py` | `GET /api/projects/{id}`, `GET /api/activities`, `GET,POST /api/comments` |
| Spec refinement | Interactive tightening of a task spec before running | Task Runner → refine | `pages/ProjectsPage.tsx` | `handlers/taskrunner.py` | `GET,POST /api/taskrunner/refine`, `POST /api/taskrunner/refine/answer` |
| Subagents | Background agent runs spawned from a session | Chat activity viewer; rail badge | `pages/chat/ActivityViewer.tsx` | `handlers/messaging.py` | `GET,POST /api/spawn`, `POST /api/spawn/stop-all`, `GET /api/spawn/{agent_id}`, `POST /api/spawn/{agent_id}/steer` |
| Worktrees | Create a git worktree for a follow-up session | Chat follow-up card → new worktree | `pages/ChatPage.tsx` | `handlers/worktree.py` | `POST /api/worktree/create` |

## Settings

`/settings/*` is a splat route; `pages/SettingsPage.tsx` parses the trailing
segments itself (`segment[0]` = tab, `segment[1]` = sub-nav). Every row below
is `/settings/<key>`. Panels live in `pages/settings/`.

| Tab | What it is | Panel | Handler | Endpoints |

| — (cross-cutting) | Host-side backup of the browser-held settings the tabs above write, so they survive a moved dashboard port or a relocated Electron `userData`. Restores on a profile that has never reached the host; allowlist-scoped (`DURABLE_PREF_KEYS`), not every browser key | — (no panel; `lib/uiPrefs.ts` is the client) | `handlers/ui_prefs.py` | `GET,PUT /api/ui-prefs` |

Flagged-file delivery consent (`GET,POST,DELETE /api/file-delivery/consent`,
owner-gated) is listed on the `security` row because that is the tab it belongs
to, but **no panel is wired to it yet** -- the endpoints are the only way to
record or withdraw the grant today (#8793). Stated rather than implied: the
backend control landed first so the delivery gates could read it, and the panel
is a follow-up. Nothing about the grant is reachable from an agent either way;
the record sits on the sandbox-sealed keystone floor.

Instances is deliberately not a rail row: it is set up here once and switched
from the header tab strip. Webhooks carries both a preview flag and
`hiddenFromNav`, so it surfaces as this Settings tab rather than a rail row.

The UI-preference backup row carries no tab because it has no panel and nothing
for a user to reach: it is the mechanism behind the tabs above, listed so its
handler has an owner in this map. Its allowlist is explicit, so a preference
absent from `DURABLE_PREF_KEYS` is still lost on an origin change, and a value
that gates a safety confirmation (`mc-yolo-ack`) is deliberately excluded. The
contract is in
[../system-specs/modules/config.md](../system-specs/modules/config.md).

## Developer

`/developer` (`pages/DeveloperPage.tsx`), ten `?tab=` values. Internals views;
not where a user manages their own data. The former `feature-previews` tab moved
to Settings > Developer (`pages/settings/FeaturePreviewsSection.tsx`); the old
`?tab=feature-previews` link redirects there.

| Tab | What it is | Page | Handler | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `logs` | Live gateway log stream and level control | `pages/LogsPage.tsx` (`LogViewer`) | `handlers/updates.py` | `GET /api/logs`, `GET,POST /api/logs/level` |

## Popouts and embeds

Separate top-level route trees `App.tsx` selects before the dashboard chrome
renders, so nothing in them carries the sidebar.

| Route | What it is | Page |
|---|---|---|
| `/popout/chat/:slug?` | One session in its own OS window | `pages/PopoutFrame.tsx` |
| `/popout/artifact/:slug` | One artifact in its own window | `pages/ArtifactPopoutFrame.tsx` |
| `/popout/terminal` | The docked terminal, detached | `pages/TerminalPopoutFrame.tsx` |
| `/embed/chat/:slug?` | Chat embedded in a host surface | `pages/ChatPage.tsx` (`embedded`) |
| `/embed/sessions` | Session list embedded in a host surface | `pages/ChatPage.tsx` (`embedded`) |
| `/embed/settings` | Reduced settings for an embedded host | `pages/EmbedSettingsPage.tsx` |

## Redirects

Kept so old bookmarks and deep links still resolve. Adding a feature never
means adding a row here; retiring one usually does.

| From | To |
|---|---|
| `/knowledge` | `/capabilities?tab=knowledge` |
| `/agents`, `/mc-agents` | `/capabilities` |
| `/connections` | `/capabilities?tab=mcp` |
| `/overview` | `/settings/overview` |
| `/instances` | `/settings/instances` |
| `/artifacts/deploy` | `/deploy` |
| `/orchestrated/:slug?` | `/chat/:slug?` (orchestrator slot) |
| `/tasks` | Task Runner |
| anything unmatched | `/chat` |
