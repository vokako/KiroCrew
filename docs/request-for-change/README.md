# Request for Change

Design documents for changes that are large enough, risky enough, or contested
enough to be worth writing down before building. An RFC here is a **proposal and
a record of a decision** — not a description of what the code does today. For
that, read the code, or the `status` field described below.

## Index

Every status below is verified against the code — definitions *and* callers — and
against merged PR history, never taken from the document's own claims. Rows are
re-audited in waves rather than all at once, so each document's own
`last-audited` / `audited-at` front matter is the authoritative freshness signal
for that row. The `rfc-crew-agent-sdk-boundary`, `rfc-agent-config-mirror`,
`rfc-global-workflow-library` and `rfc-app-sandbox-isolation` rows, and the three
`implemented` rows, were re-audited against `424efa423`. Rows not named there are
older; when a row's `audited-at` is far behind main, distrust the status.
Last audited **2026-08-03** against main `0ab6ed48`. Every status below was
verified against the code (definitions *and* callers) and against merged/open PR
history, not taken from the document's own claims. The `rfc-tailnet-dashboard-access`
row was added later and re-verified against `429cbad8`, and `rfc-session-address-model`
was added later still and verified against `b23ab77af`; the
`rfc-everything-is-an-app` and `rfc-amend-tenets-everything-is-an-app` rows
were added
2026-08-18 and verified against `e6b06685e`; the other rows have
not been re-audited since 2026-08-03. The durable-run-coordinator row was added
2026-08-22 and the orchestrator-chat-sessions row was re-audited at
`c4f253891`; the `rfc-token-efficient-monitors` row was added 2026-08-22 and
verified against `6d3e30bbbd`. The `rfc-global-workflow-library` row was added
2026-08-25 and audited against `749468d42`; its implementation exists only in
the active detached worktree. The `rfc-agentcore-identity-gateway` row
was added 2026-08-27. The `rfc-crew-agent-sdk-boundary` row was added 2026-08-28 and verified against `dc88f142b`. The `rfc-transcript-section-markers` row was added 2026-08-30 and verified against `202770d13`. The `rfc-mcp-lifecycle-event-log` row was added 2026-09-01 and verified against `1ee69f225`. The `rfc-session-tag-change-event` row was added 2026-09-02 and verified against `6581a04ee`. The `rfc-agent-config-mirror` row was added 2026-09-02 and verified against `f8b3203c0`. The `rfc-chat-core-extraction` row was added 2026-09-05 and verified against `8ed028b0b`. The `rfc-conductor-work-ledger` row was added 2026-09-05 and verified against `049b8c729`. The `rfc-app-session-controls` row was added 2026-08-31 and re-verified against `1d705a03f` on 2026-09-01.

| Document | Status | What is actually on main |
|---|---|---|
| [rfc-remote-instance-on-fargate.md](rfc-remote-instance-on-fargate.md) | `draft` | Nothing. Verified at `8fd5193e6`: the only `LaunchEngine` implementation is `RealLaunchEngine` in `cloud/launch_engine.py`, which calls `ec2.deploy`; `cloud_launch_engine` in `dashboard/state.py` is injectable but set only by tests; `sizes.py` fixes the three shapes to instance types; nothing in `src/kiro_crew/cloud/` references Fargate, ECS or `RunTask`. |
| [rfc-conductor-work-ledger.md](rfc-conductor-work-ledger.md) | `draft` | Nothing. Verified at `e992b7771`: no `work_report` / `work_brief` / `work_ledger_*` tool exists, `_MANAGED_MCP_SERVERS` carries no `kirocrew-work` entry and `agent.py` installs no `kirocrew-worker` spec, `data_home()/work-ledger/` is not a path any module builds, and `probes/__init__.py` `build` maps exactly one kind (`gh-pr`). The conductor still learns worker state only by `session_read_message`, and `goal-conductor/scripts/ledger_entry.py` still encodes each item into a `session_ledger` `artifacts` value under a 32-entry cap |
| [rfc-session-tag-change-event.md](rfc-session-tag-change-event.md) | `draft` | Nothing. Verified at `6581a04ee`: `SessionTagsChanged` has zero hits in the tree, and `HOOK_EVENTS` (`hooks.py:93-99`) and `ALLOWED_HOOK_EVENTS` (`validation.py:92-94`) still carry exactly the five turn-lifecycle events. Tag writes still only `push_slots_update()` to the browser with no server-side consumer |
| [rfc-agent-config-mirror.md](rfc-agent-config-mirror.md) | `partial` | The `providers/mirrors/` package it proposes is on main — `base.py`, `claude_code.py`, `registry.py` and the package's own `README.md` — so the seam and the Claude Code mirror exist. The three pre-existing unnamed mirrors it consolidates are all still real: `providers/acp.py`'s `_write_cli_overlay` + `_write_tool_search_overlay` (kiro-cli's `cli.json`), `acp/kas_agents.py` + `acp/kas_permissions.py` (KAS `customAgents` over the wire), and `client.py`'s `_write_claude_local_settings`. Unstarted: the interface on `LLMProvider`, the disposition vocabulary, the parity test, `acp/session_mcp.py`. Both hooks gaps it names are live: `hooks` sits in `kas_agents.UNSUPPORTED_SPEC_KEYS` and is never written for Claude Code. The mirror contract is documented in two places — `providers/mirrors/README.md` and [`../system-specs/modules/providers.md`](../system-specs/modules/providers.md) — and which one owns it is unresolved |
| [rfc-mcp-lifecycle-event-log.md](rfc-mcp-lifecycle-event-log.md) | `draft` | The events package it builds on is real (`src/kiro_crew/events/`: envelope, registry, read-only backfill validator, landed by [#3808](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/3808)), but nothing emits and nothing reads: no writer module, no `seq` field, no `mcp/` kinds. The #7366 capture points it names as emit sites are on an open PR, not on main |
| [rfc-app-session-controls.md](rfc-app-session-controls.md) | `accepted` | Ships with its implementation in #7573. Verified at `1d705a03f`, before that PR: `UIConfig` declares `entry`/`pages`/`overlays`/`sidebar` and no session-scoped surface, and the app SDK's public files carry zero `sessionKey`/`session_key`/`activeSession`/`currentSession` hits — so no app can discover the chat it is rendered beside. Implementation (manifest field + composer host + status polling) lands in the same PR; S1 and S2 are deliberately not separable |
| [rfc-transcript-section-markers.md](rfc-transcript-section-markers.md) | `draft` | Nothing. No `section_marker` role exists; every collapse affordance is intra-turn (`CollapsibleToolGroup`, `TurnBlock`, `ToolCallLine`) and nothing collapses rows above a point |
| [rfc-crew-agent-sdk-boundary.md](rfc-crew-agent-sdk-boundary.md) | `partial` | Both named deliverables are on main: the `agent_sdk` package (`drivers/acp.py`, `backend_identity.py`, `provider_identity.py`, `backend_install.py`, `native_commands.py`) and the shrink-only import ratchet `scripts/check_agent_sdk_boundary.py`. What remains is the cleanup the boundary was declared to enable: `providers/base.py` still aliases `AcpEvent` as the "provider-agnostic" event type, direct `kiro_crew.acp` import edges remain outside `acp/` and `providers/`, and `acp/worker_pool.py` still imports back from `session_pid.py` behind a cycle guard |
| [rfc-global-workflow-library.md](rfc-global-workflow-library.md) | `partial` | The global definition library is on main: `workflows/library.py` persists definitions under `<KIROCREW_HOME>/workflow_library/`, the `workflow_library_list` MCP tool reads it, and Agent Capabilities > Workflows carries the **Workflow library** and **Runs** views. [`../system-specs/modules/workflows.md`](../system-specs/modules/workflows.md) owns the shipped shape, including the import layering that keeps `library` below `service`. Slug persistence and promotion ship; a chat `/workflow <name>` invocation resolving a saved slug is not on main |
| [rfc-durable-run-coordinator.md](rfc-durable-run-coordinator.md) | `draft` | Nothing. Design and seven-PR additive migration stack only; the existing in-memory manager and run folders remain authoritative |
| [rfc-issue-radar-crews.md](rfc-issue-radar-crews.md) | `draft` | Nothing. Design of record only; `crew_brief.md` and `crew_ledger_spec.md` sit beside the Issue Radar backend as companion specs, also unimplemented |
| [rfc-orchestrator-chat-sessions.md](rfc-orchestrator-chat-sessions.md) | `partial` | Crew Mode shipped in [#1295](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/1295) and has since received store and routing fixes. The implementation deliberately diverges from the RFC in at least three places: no snapshot-generation CAS, no `release` decision action, and immediate per-result delivery instead of burst coalescing |
| [rfc-channel-plugin-architecture.md](rfc-channel-plugin-architecture.md) | `partial` | Shared turn pipeline shipped; **4 of 7** channels adopted. Registry/seam collapse, telegram+discord, Feishu unstarted. Its §9 address rule is separately half-shipped — audit this row alongside [rfc-session-address-model.md](rfc-session-address-model.md) |
| [rfc-session-address-model.md](rfc-session-address-model.md) | `partial` | The dashboard half of the channel-plugin RFC's §9 rule 1 shipped ([#1366](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/1366) plus four follow-ups): a chat-app conversation opened in a dashboard tab is no longer copied into a second session, and `has_dashboard_surface` (7 callers) replaced the name-prefix capability tests. All four phases it proposes are unstarted — 23 named key converters and 5 copies of the session-type ladder remain, surface capability is still one boolean, and an unbound channel tab still starts a second session against the same transcript file |
| [rfc-local-notification-bus.md](rfc-local-notification-bus.md) | `partial` | Phases 1/3/4 complete. Phase 2 wired but has no producer; Phase 5 shipped 2 of 3 |
| [rfc-federated-app-platform.md](rfc-federated-app-platform.md) | `partial` | Phase 1 substantially shipped, Phase 3 half-built. Phase 2, Phase 1's removals, Phase 4, Phase 5 unstarted |
| [rfc-workspace-config-evolution.md](rfc-workspace-config-evolution.md) | `partial` | Phases 1–2 shipped. Phase 3's vector isolation was **reversed** on purpose; Phase 4 unstarted |
| [rfc-resumable-subagent-sessions.md](rfc-resumable-subagent-sessions.md) | `partial` | Phase 0 ran and **redirected the design**: continuable conversations shipped instead of the record-store ladder |
| [rfc-i18n-measurement.md](rfc-i18n-measurement.md) | `partial` | Overflow gate shipped, `localeCompare` migration partial. All three *measurement* proposals unstarted |
| [rfc-appstore-official-registry.md](rfc-appstore-official-registry.md) | `partial` | The official fetch and editorial-driven Discover are live (`apps/official_catalog.py`, `apps/official_editorial.py`); signature verification and tombstone resolution are deliberately absent and fail closed. **§4 diverged** — four of its decisions about categories were reversed in the sibling `KiroCrewApps` repo; the note at its head says which |
| [rfc-notification-bridge.md](rfc-notification-bridge.md) | `accepted` | Nothing — zero implementation code |
| [rfc-tips-kit.md](rfc-tips-kit.md) | `draft` | Nothing. T1 was built and **retracted** ([#775](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/775)); the design section needs revising first |
| [rfc-update-architecture.md](rfc-update-architecture.md) | `draft` | Nothing — zero of three phases |
| [rfc-app-sandbox-isolation.md](rfc-app-sandbox-isolation.md) | `draft` | Nothing. Apps still run in-process with full privileges (see `docs/architecture/app-platform-trust-model.md`); no isolation code exists |
| [rfc-issue-radar-dispatch.md](rfc-issue-radar-dispatch.md) | `draft` | Nothing. Issue Radar has Investigate and Review; no verb produces work, and issues carry no link to the change that resolves them |
| [rfc-perpetual-agent.md](rfc-perpetual-agent.md) | `draft` | Nothing. Verified at `9ac3716a`: no schedule kind self-reschedules, and `binding_key_for` has no `cron:` branch |
| [rfc-token-efficient-monitors.md](rfc-token-efficient-monitors.md) | `in-progress` | Nothing on main. The complete active eight-PR stack ([#5180](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/5180) through [#5305](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/5305)) implements the durable model, completed-turn accounting, provider probes, session-bound control tools, dashboard controls, bounded babysit routing, and GitHub/GitLab/Azure DevOps/Bitbucket review-readiness adapters. Re-audited at `904da5537` |
| [rfc-consolidated-monitor.md](rfc-consolidated-monitor.md) | `draft` | Nothing of the merge. Verified at `ef38f4cbe`: `probes/__init__.py` `build` maps exactly one kind (`gh-pr`); `monitoring/github_pull_request.py` still reduces a pull request to one fingerprint with no named-entry list, and `decide_monitor` compares that single `fingerprint` against `last_wake_fingerprint`; no coalescing pre-stage reaches the controller, the window exists only in `irq.py`; and `api_autonudge_get` still nulls a structured monitor out, so the goal popover cannot see one |
| [rfc-tailnet-dashboard-access.md](rfc-tailnet-dashboard-access.md) | `partial` | Phase 1 landed ([#1761](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/1761), `f8afcff7`) — reports the pin's real scope, does not fix it. Phases 2–4 unstarted; the pin repair is tracked as [#1762](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/issues/1762) |
| [rfc-pluggable-model-providers.md](rfc-pluggable-model-providers.md) | `draft` | Nothing, by design. `agent.provider` is still fixed to `acp` and [oss-fork-boundaries](../system-specs/oss-fork-boundaries.md) lists "Other providers" under *Never re-add*. This document **recommends** supporting provider choice and asks the maintainers to amend that rule; it proposes no design, and an exploratory implementation is shelved pending the answer ([#1693](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/issues/1693)) |
| [rfc-s3-backup.md](rfc-s3-backup.md) | `draft` | Nothing. Verified at `f4d3327a7`: `VALID_COMPONENTS` carries no session component and no code path writes crew state to a remote store |
| [rfc-navigation-placement-seam.md](rfc-navigation-placement-seam.md) | `draft` | Nothing. Verified at `2a665e735`: `UISidebar` ships in the manifest and no frontend code reads `ui.sidebar`; `appNavTarget` still resolves `pages[0]` only, and `registerBuiltinSurface` is not one of the nine edition seams |
| [rfc-append-only-session-transcript.md](rfc-append-only-session-transcript.md) | `draft` | Nothing. Verified at `2a665e735`: `_save_slot_to_history` still re-serializes the whole in-memory window on every flush, and `rewrite_session` / `sliding_window` still have no production caller |
| [version-compliance-framework.md](version-compliance-framework.md) | `draft` | Nothing. Framework doc, not an RFC; premise is pre-fork and stale |
| [rfc-everything-is-an-app.md](rfc-everything-is-an-app.md) | `draft` | Nothing. Phase 0's boundary section is in this document's own branch and not yet merged; the eleven declared-but-unread manifest fields it inventories are all still declared and still unread |
| [rfc-amend-tenets-everything-is-an-app.md](rfc-amend-tenets-everything-is-an-app.md) | `draft` | Nothing. `TENETS.md` still carries seven tenets on main. `git log --follow` on it shows two commits and no prior amendment, and `grep -i tenet` returns zero hits in `GOVERNANCE.md` |
| [rfc-chat-core-extraction.md](rfc-chat-core-extraction.md) | `partial` | P1 shipped: `app-sdk/messageRenderers.tsx` is the role registry with a parity contract test ([#5128](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/5128)). P2 shipped for one surface: `website/src/chat-core/transport/sendTurn.ts` exists and `components/ChatPane.tsx` is its only production caller ([#5909](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/5909)); ChatEmbed, SideChat and ChatPage still hand-roll their POST on main (open PRs [#8599](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/8599), [#8655](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/8655), [#8689](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/8689)). P3 shipped for SideChat (`pages/chat/SideChat.tsx` mounts `ChatInput`); `app-sdk/ChatEmbed.tsx` still renders a bare `<input>` on main. Verified at `8ed028b0b`: `ChatPage.tsx` carries 29 `role ===` branches (P5 unstarted) |
| [rfc-crew-projects.md](rfc-crew-projects.md) | `draft` | Nothing. Verified at `5cd92ff99`: no project manifest format exists, `slot.project` is a bare directory path, and `grep -ril "confluence\|servicenow" src/kiro_crew` returns zero hits |
| [rfc-tool-derived-diff-cards.md](rfc-tool-derived-diff-cards.md) | `in-progress` | Ships with [#5012](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/5012): dashboard diff-card/summary promotion + runtime-selected prompt rule. The messaging `OutputEvent` extension (§3.3) is unstarted |
| [rfc-agentcore-identity-gateway.md](rfc-agentcore-identity-gateway.md) | `in-progress` | First stack PR lands the `agent_identity` CPP slot, `DefaultAgentIdentityProvider` no-op, `capabilities.agentcore` catalog row, and AWS-free policy validators. No AWS extra, no Gateway inject, no login attach, no Settings UI |
| [rfc-playwright-cli-migration.md](rfc-playwright-cli-migration.md) | `partial` | `playwright-cli` is the live backend: `browser_cli/` carries install, launch, snapshot retention and OS deps, the capability model is in `config/sections.py`, and the write-path gates are in `platform/governance.py`. [`../system-specs/modules/browser.md`](../system-specs/modules/browser.md) owns the landed contract. **Phase 3's removal of `browser/` did not happen** — `browser/command_bus.py` and `browser/__init__.py` remain, `dashboard/handlers/messaging.py` imports the command bus, and `test_browser_command_bus.py` pins it |
| [rfc-pipeline-conductor.md](rfc-pipeline-conductor.md) | `partial` | M0 shipped: `kirocrew-pipeline-conductor` is registered in `subagent.py`'s `UNADVERTISED_AGENTS`, and the `pipeline-conductor` builtin skill carries the operating procedure, its bundled scripts and the `conductor-status/v1` schema. Unbuilt: M1's `PipelineSpec` and SQLite event store (`PipelineSpec` has no code hit outside the RFC), M2's adjudication and SLA machinery, M3's baking, compensation and per-repo objects; five decisions remain open. [`system-specs/modules/pipeline-conductor.md`](../system-specs/modules/pipeline-conductor.md) owns the shipped half |
| [rfc-prepare-pr-portability.md](rfc-prepare-pr-portability.md) | `implemented` | Shipped. `resolve_profile.py` in the `prepare-pr` skill's `scripts/` implements the four-step resolution order (`.prepare-pr.toml` → Kiro Crew markers → stack auto-detect → generic fallback) and parses the `[project]` / `[setup].commands` / `[gates].commands` schema through `tomllib` with a `tomli` fallback |
| [rfc-app-sdk-durable-jobs-and-view-state.md](rfc-app-sdk-durable-jobs-and-view-state.md) | draft | A gateway-side durable run record so a long app action survives unmount and restart, plus URL-backed view state. Nothing shipped. |
| [rfc-security-conductor.md](rfc-security-conductor.md) | `draft` | Nothing. Design of record only; no agent, skill, script or rules-of-engagement file exists. Verified at `e992b7771`: `security-conductor` and `rules-of-engagement` return zero hits in the tree, and `scope_check` matches only the unrelated `app_scope_check` and `scope_check_exception` symbols |

One document is `implemented`: the design landed whole and the row names the spec
that owns the shipped behaviour. Nothing here is `superseded`.

## Implementation plans

[plans/](plans/README.md) holds the dated, task-by-task execution plans derived
from documents in this directory. A plan is the *how* and belongs beside the RFC
it executes; the RFC stays the *what* and the *why*. A plan's checkboxes are its
own progress record and are not a status source — read the RFC's `status` for
that, and read the plan's own head note for whether it is live or dormant.

## Front matter

Every document carries YAML front matter as the machine-readable record. The
prose header below it stays human-readable and carries the *why*; front matter
carries the *what*.

```yaml
---
title: Channel Plugin Architecture — shared runtime, channels as app extension points
status: partial            # see vocabulary below
author: zezhexu
created: 2026-07-28
last-audited: 2026-08-03   # when status was last verified against code
audited-at: 0ab6ed48       # the commit it was verified against
doc-pr: 689                # the PR that merged this document
implementation-prs: [777, 1019, 1234]
tracking-issues: []
supersedes: []
superseded-by: []
---
```

Optional keys: `kind: framework` for docs that are policy rather than a
reviewable change to a named component, and `revision:` where a document is
versioned across review rounds.

`last-audited` and `audited-at` exist because a bare `status: partial` rots
silently. If those two fields are far behind main, distrust the status.

### Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `draft` | Proposed. Nothing built. |
| `accepted` | Design agreed and locked. Nothing built yet. |
| `in-progress` | Implementation is live in an open PR or an active branch. |
| `partial` | Some phases are on main; the rest are open. The prose status line names which. |
| `implemented` | Every phase is verifiably on main. |
| `superseded` | Replaced. `superseded-by` names the replacement. |

`partial` is the most common status and the most dangerous one to read
carelessly — several documents here describe a plan that main only partly
follows, and two describe a plan main **deliberately diverged from**.

## Reading a `partial` or divergent RFC

Three failure modes are live in this directory. Each document's prose status line
calls out its own, but the patterns are worth knowing before you trust any of them:

1. **The plan was overtaken.** `rfc-resumable-subagent-sessions.md` had its
   Phase 0 probe return a negative verdict, which redirected the whole design —
   what shipped (continuable conversations) is not what the phases below it
   describe. `rfc-workspace-config-evolution.md` had its Phase 3 vector-store
   isolation affirmatively reversed by a later commit. Neither document was
   revised afterwards. `rfc-appstore-official-registry.md` is the same pattern
   caught late but *revised*: four of §4's decisions about categories were
   reversed as R1 shipped, and the section now opens with a note saying which,
   so the reasoning survives as a record without still reading as the contract.
2. **The credit is not the RFC's.** `rfc-i18n-measurement.md` shows `partial`,
   but the proposals that shipped were already in flight under a separate
   program, one of them merging 18 hours before the document did.
3. **A dependency claim is overstated.** `rfc-notification-bridge.md` asserts the
   bus RFC's phases "all shipped". The phases the bridge actually needs are real;
   the blanket claim is not.

When a document and the code disagree, the code wins and the document is a bug.
Fix it in the same PR that discovers the drift.

## Writing a new RFC

[GOVERNANCE.md](../../GOVERNANCE.md) covers who decides whether an RFC is
accepted, and the scope test for when a change needs one at all.

- File as `rfc-<topic>.md`, kebab-case. Framework or policy docs that propose no
  reviewable change to a named component drop the prefix and set `kind: framework`.
- Open with front matter, then an H1 `# RFC: <Title>`, then the prose header.
- Write in English.
- Structure that has worked here: Summary → Motivation (current state, problems)
  → Goals → Non-goals → Design → Migration plan (phased, each phase PR-sized with
  **exit criteria**) → Backward compatibility → Security considerations →
  Alternatives considered → Open questions.
- Phases earn their keep by being independently shippable and independently
  abandonable. State exit criteria as assertions someone can test, and mark any
  phase whose entry depends on an unanswered open question as blocked on it.
- **Verify before asserting.** Claims of the form "X does not exist" or "Y is
  unused" are the ones that most often turn out wrong. Grep for callers, not just
  definitions — a defined-but-uncalled symbol means the behavior does not happen,
  which is a different (and usually more interesting) finding than absence.
  Quote `file:line`. Name the commit you measured at, as
  `rfc-i18n-measurement.md` does.
- A probe phase that exists to answer a question must write its verdict down
  somewhere durable and the RFC must be updated to point at it. PR #1023 recorded
  its Phase 0 verdict in the PR description; the RFC still does not reference it,
  which is why that document now needs a reader's warning.

## Keeping this honest

When you land an implementation PR for anything here, update the document's
`status`, `implementation-prs`, `last-audited` and `audited-at` in the same PR,
and re-audit the whole directory whenever the table above starts feeling
plausible rather than checked. The audit is cheap: for each document, extract its
named deliverables, grep for each one's definition and callers, and check the PR
history for the phase that claims to have landed it.
