 *  `assistant` branch, overwrite a live stream with stale text.
 *
 *  Identity is the server-minted row id `meta.mid` (`_ChatSlot.append`), and
 *  nothing else. The backend stamps it once per row and every door the row can
 *  arrive through carries it: the slot-detail HTTP rebuild, the live
 *  `chat_message` broadcast, and the JSONL round trip (persisted with `meta`,
 *  restored with it), so the two copies of one row are recognisably one row.
 *
 *  What this replaces, and why: a (`ts`, role, content) tuple cannot express
 *  this. A coarse OS clock stamps two rows appended in the same tick identically
 *  (the collision `mergePreservedClientTs` pass 1 already guards against) and two
 *  byte-identical messages are legitimate — a Slack channel window can replay
 *  exactly that pair. So a tuple either misses a redelivery (a duplicate bubble)
 *  or matches two distinct rows (a message silently disappears), and no tuning
 *  removes the ambiguity. An explicit id does.
 *
 *  A frame with NO `mid` is never treated as a duplicate: rows a client mints
 *  locally (streaming, thinking, optimistic bubbles) have no server identity yet,
 *  and channel-replayed rows genuinely carry no `meta` at all (`ConversationLog`
 *  writes only role/content/ts/source_* for those). Declining to dedup renders a
 *  duplicate at worst; guessing would drop a real message.
 *
 *  Called from ONE chokepoint per path, placed so it dominates every branch that
 *  creates OR mutates a row — the `tool` insert, the `assistant` reconcile (which
 *  overwrites the trailing `streaming` row, so a late redelivery of an old frame
 *  would clobber a NEW segment's live content), the `user` echo reconcile, and
 *  the generic push. A guard sitting after any of those is a guard some frame
 *  slips past.

 *
 * A switch used to go UNBOUNDED for any slot with rows already painted, and the
 * comment beside it carried its own measurement: 6.2MB/~1s unbounded against
 * 0.7MB/57ms bounded. So the FIRST visit to a session was the fast one and every
 * return to it paid for the whole chained transcript — on a 43MB session that is
 * the reported "switching chats got slow and janky", and it got worse as more
 * history became reachable.
 *
 * The reason for going unbounded was real but narrower than the rule: a bounded
 * page is a WINDOW, and if the server grew past it the window could sit entirely
 * newer than the cache, leaving a hole in the middle of the transcript. That is
 * a question of COVERAGE, not of boundedness — and coverage is VERIFIED after the
 * response (`slotCoverageShortfall` asks which cached rows the window does not
 * contain), so it does not have to be pre-purchased with a larger window.
 *
 * Which matters because the window extends BACKWARD from the newest row: every
 * row of headroom is a row of OLDER history nobody asked for. Buying a page of
 * margin therefore grew the transcript upward by a page on every revisit, and
 * since the next revisit measures the cache it just grew, it ratcheted — one page
 * per switch until the handler ceiling. Reported from a phone as history loading
 * itself on every session switch, from a reader parked at the live end, with no
 * gesture and no spinner (this path never sets `loadingOlder`, so it is invisible
 * to every guard on the automatic older-history doors).
 *
 * So ask for exactly what this tab already holds — never fewer than one page —
 * and let the coverage check pay for the rare case instead.
 *
 * A STREAMING slot is not an exception to that, though it used to be. The
 * carve-out rested on the same pre-purchase argument the paragraph above
 * retires: unseen growth can push a window clear of a small cache. That is the
 * hole the coverage check verifies for, and it verifies it for a streaming
 * response exactly as it does for a settled one — so the streaming exemption was
 * the retired argument surviving in the one branch that did not get revisited.
 *
 * What it cost is the whole point of bounding: a slot mid-turn is the most likely
 * slot a reader switches away from and back to, so the exemption applied the
 * unbounded shape to the commonest switch there is. Measured on a phone as one
 * switch into a streaming session turning 303 loaded messages into 6,265 (7,303
 * raw rows, ~293,000px of transcript) with no gesture, no spinner, and no paging
 * door involved -- and, because the whole transcript is replaced at once, the
 * reader's saved position with it.
 *
 * Order matters here: bounding this is only safe once a streaming response can
 * leave a comparable baseline behind (`retainServerTotal`). Without one the
 * coverage check cannot prove overlap, and every streaming switch would take the
 * unbounded RETRY instead — the same payload, one round-trip later.

 * a tab holding one page of a long transcript and a tab whose slot grew past its cache
 * look identical as counts (`cached` small, `serverTotal` large), so a count comparison
 * has to assume the worst whenever it has no earlier total to subtract -- which is every
 * FIRST visit to a slot. That assumption read an entire transcript to close a gap that
 * was not there: measured on a phone as 110 loaded messages becoming 2,645 with a server
 * total of 2,644, on a slot whose window already covered its cache exactly.
 *
 * Ordering cannot answer it either, and three rounds of boundary defects came from
 * trying: comparing timestamps as strings, then treating a row tied with the window's
 * oldest as covered, then collapsing two identical rows into one. Each is a different
 * way for "is this row in that set" to be inferred from "is this row older than that
 * row" -- so the fix is to ASK the real question. A row is covered when the window
 * holds a matching row, and each window row can cover only ONE cached row, which is
 * what makes duplicates count.
 *
 * A row the server does not KEEP is skipped on both sides, read through the shared
 * `isDurableRow`. `CLIENT_ONLY_ROLES` -- `queued`, `streaming`, `thinking`,
 * `permission` -- exist only in this client, so the server's window cannot contain one
 * however wide it is asked to be. Counting one as missing is therefore not a hole that
 * a bigger read closes: it is a shortfall that never goes away, so EVERY switch into a
 * slot holding a queued message or a permission card refetches the whole transcript.
 * A narrower test came first here -- skip a row whose `ts` cannot be read -- which
 * happened to catch `streaming` and missed the other three, and the same file already
 * carried the right predicate two consumers deep.
 *
 * The unreadable-`ts` skip stays, for its own reason rather than that one: a row that
 * cannot be placed in time has no whole identity key to match on. An unstamped row is
 * also a live TAIL row, which a newest-N window necessarily reaches, so skipping it
 * cannot hide a hole above it.

 *
 *  A block with NO recorded anchor because nothing followed it in the old list
 *  (the live turn's in-flight reasoning) is appended at the tail: the tail IS
 *  its position. A block whose anchor scan was CUT SHORT by a turn-boundary
 *  user row (a turn stopped mid-reasoning, or one that emitted no tool call
 *  and no answer text) is also anchorless, but its turn is OVER — it is kept
 *  at the tail only while the pure server page does not cover that boundary
 *  row; once it does, the block is dropped like a covered anchored miss
 *  (#5815), since keeping it stranded one permanent chip per stopped turn
 *  below unrelated newer turns, re-appended on every refresh. A block whose
 *  anchor MISSES its lookup is dropped or kept by where the anchor sits
 *  relative to the region the PURE server page (`coverageSource`) actually
 *  covers:
 *
 *  - **Inside the covered region** (at or before the last `existing` row that
 *    `incoming` recognizably contains), with a server-confirmed anchor (a
 *    server-minted tool id, or answer text carrying a server `ts`): the
 *    snapshot covers that span of history yet does not contain the anchor —
 *    the block's position is gone (a bounded page: `switchSlot` on an idle
 *    slot fetches only `OLDER_PAGE_LIMIT` rows, while preserved blocks span
 *    the whole tab lifetime). DROP it. Appending those used to stack every
 *    out-of-window block from hours of turns as a wall of bare "Thinking"
 *    chips at the transcript tail, re-appended on every later refresh
 *    (#5798). Dropping matches what a full page reload does anyway —
 *    reasoning is client-only and never survives one.
 *  - **Past the covered region** (the anchor row is newer than everything the
 *    snapshot knows): a racing mid-turn refresh (WS reconnect) snapshots the
 *    server, then a tool frame or more streamed text lands BEFORE the fetch
 *    fulfills — the anchor is absent from `incoming` because the snapshot is
 *    older than it, not because history dropped it. KEEP the block (tail
 *    append; the live turn is the tail). The same applies to an anchor that
 *    was never server-confirmed (a `streaming` row, or a text row without a
 *    server `ts`) — its text can grow past what any snapshot holds.
 *
 *  Coverage is measured conservatively: the last `existing` row whose identity
 *  (tool id / `mid` / role+`ts` / role+text) appears in `incoming`. When
 *  nothing matches, nothing is dropped — declining to guess loses at worst a
 *  misplaced chip, while guessing wrong deletes live reasoning.
 *
 *  The anchor is the FOLLOWING TOOL CALL's `tool_call_id` when there is one, and
 *  the following answer text only otherwise. A tool id is the sharper key and
 *  the only one that scales: `_tool_meta` mints it server-side and persists it on
 *  the tool row, so it survives into history and reads back identically on a
 *  historical replay. Answer content does not scale, because a turn that reasons
 *  before each of N tool calls emits no text at those boundaries — the backend's
 *  segment flush is gated on pending text (`chat_runner._flush_segment`, called
 *  under `if not in_tool_group and assistant_text`) — so history holds ONE
 *  assistant row for all N bursts. Anchoring every burst on that single row let
 *  exactly one land and parked the other N-1 at the tail, below the answer and
 *  its footer, as a column of collapsed rows that read as duplicates (#4218).
 *
 *  Bursts and anchors are 1:1 under the tool rule: burst k is followed by tool k,
 *  and the final burst by the answer. An auto-approved call emits two tool rows
 *  sharing one id (🔧 pre-approval + ✅ post-approval, see
 *  `applyToolOutputToMessages`); `used` makes the first win, which is the earlier
 *  row and so the correct side of the pair.
 *
 *  A block this function decides has no position here is handed to
 *  `orphanSink` when the caller supplied one, rather than discarded:
 *  `state.messages` is its only copy, so a later page that loads its anchor
 *  can re-seat it. With no sink it is dropped as before. Either way it
 *  leaves the rendered list, so the #5798 tail wall stays cured. */

  // and persisted roles beyond the common five (inject, subagent, …) count

  // and letting it match would extend the coverage cut past a live
  // post-snapshot anchor on the strength of the WRONG row — deleting live
  // reasoning, the exact failure the never-stacked rule exists to prevent.
  // The pre-echo pair is one occurrence in EACH list, so duplication is

     *
     *  `workflow_run_event` frames are one-shot and never replayed, so a client
     *  that was closed, asleep, or disconnected when a run ended holds an entry
     *  frozen at `running` forever: the spinner keeps spinning, the phase and log
     *  lines keep rendering as live, and the terminal-linger cleanup — which only
     *  tracks entries that have reached a terminal status — never arms to drop it.
     *  A gateway restart is the same case from the other side: the registry marks
     *  a run that was still running as failed (interrupted), and only this read
     *  carries that to a tab that stayed open across the restart.
     *
     *  The merge is deliberately MONOTONIC, because the snapshot is a point-in-time
     *  read that races the live stream (frames can land while the request is in
     *  flight) and a workflow status only ever moves one way, running → terminal:
     *   - a local entry already TERMINAL is never touched — the snapshot cannot be
     *     newer than the frame that ended it, so "re-opening" it could only undo
     *     truth the client already has;
     *   - a running local entry is only ever advanced to terminal, never rewound;
     *   - progress fields (`phase`, `lastLog`) are filled only when EMPTY, since a
     *     live frame's value is newer than any value this response carries;
     *   - a row absent locally is SEEDED only while it is still running — that is
     *     the reload / late-join case (nothing else seeds this slice, so a run
     *     started before the tab opened is otherwise invisible). A terminal row is
     *     never resurrected: the run is over and re-adding it would show a wall of
     *     ✓ rows above the composer on every reconnect.
     *   - an unrecognised status is not evidence and is skipped entirely, so a
     *     future backend state cannot silently clear a spinner or seed a row.
     *
     *  A failed request must NOT reach here at all: an absent list means the
     *  authority could not be read, not that no runs exist. Callers pass only a
     *  real `runs` array (see `syncWorkflowRuns` in useWebSocket).
     *
     *  Absence from a SUCCESSFUL response is likewise not evidence: the registry
     *  evicts old runs (200 by default), so a long-lived entry can legitimately
     *  drop out of the list. Such an entry is left alone rather than guessed at.

    /** Accumulate streamed model reasoning (`chat_thinking` WS event) into a
     *  content-bearing `thinking`-role message — ONE BLOCK PER REASONING BURST.
     *  A turn that reasons, calls a tool, then reasons again therefore renders
     *  two blocks, each above the step it explains. Scanning back to the turn
     *  boundary instead appends every later burst into the FIRST burst's block,
     *  so a multi-tool turn collapsed all of its reasoning under the opening one.
     *
     *  Placement is anchored on the turn's open `streaming` row, located
     *  directly rather than inferred from the array tail: a turn's visible text
     *  accumulates into ONE row that stays open across tool calls (the backend
     *  flushes each segment without broadcasting), and reasoning belongs ABOVE
     *  it, exactly as the `tool` branch inserts ahead of it. The tail is NOT the
     *  end of the turn — an approval row, a queued bubble, a stop event, an
     *  error card and a `file` card are all appended BELOW that open row, so
     *  measuring from `length` would drop the block beneath the answer it
     *  explains. With no open row (reasoning before any text) the block appends,
     *  which is also correct: it lands after whatever opened the turn.
     *
     *  A CONFIRMED steer is injected into the running turn, so reasoning after
     *  it continues the burst it interrupted; an unconfirmed (optimistic) steer
     *  is a raced real turn and does close the burst — see isTurnBoundaryUser.
     *
     *  A `tool` row BELOW that open text row means the rows are already out of
     *  emission order: the `tool` branch steps back over a trailing `streaming`
     *  row but not over an approval row, so an approval-gated call lands beneath
     *  the text. The tool is then the turn's latest step, so the burst that
     *  preceded it is closed and the new one belongs after it — appending is the
     *  only placement that satisfies both, and it is what stops a post-tool
     *  burst being concatenated into the pre-tool block. */
