/**
 * InstancesViewport — renders the remote instance panes inside the pane stack
 * below the top instance tab bar (see InstanceTabBar / App.tsx). Each connected
 * instance's dashboard is an absolutely-positioned, full-bleed <iframe>; the
 * active instance is shown and the rest stay warm (mounted, hidden). The whole
 * stack is hidden when the Local tab is active so the native dashboard (a
 * sibling pane) shows through — nothing is unmounted, so switching is instant.
 *
 * Load-bearing rules:
 * - **Hide-not-unmount**: every warm instance's <iframe> stays mounted; only
 *   `display` toggles. Unmounting would reload the remote + re-run the token
 *   handshake and lose scroll/session state. This holds across Local<->remote
 *   switches too (the stack is display:none on Local, not unmounted).
 * - **Warm-set cap** (instances.warm_set_cap): keep at most K warm iframes;
 *   exceeding the cap evicts (unmounts) the least-recently-used non-active
 *   iframe. Eviction does NOT disconnect the tunnel — the tab persists and
 *   re-warms on next click. Tabs are removed only by an explicit disconnect.
 * - **Origin-validated unread relay**: trust postMessage counts only
 *   from a known loopback tunnel origin.
 *
 * For an active instance with no warm iframe (down / reconnecting after a
 * restart) it renders an in-pane error/reconnect panel; otherwise it renders
 * nothing only when nothing is warm.
 *
 * - **Pane readiness**: a warm iframe is only trusted once its
 *   embedded SPA posts `mc-embedded-ready` for the current src. Until then the
 *   active pane shows a loading overlay that carries the tab strip (the local
 *   header is hidden while a remote tab is active, so without it a slow or
 *   dead load would strand the user on a black pane with no tabs). If readiness
 *   never arrives within PANE_LOAD_TIMEOUT_MS the error panel surfaces with
 *   Retry, which force-reloads the iframe even for an identical re-minted src.

                  the same error panel and read the button as dead, while each
                  further click stacked another copy of the prompt onto the
                  hand-off QUEUE. The only other `setActiveId(null)` comes from the
                  embedded pane's own switcher, and that iframe is exactly what
                  failed here. Timed AFTER on purpose: leaving the panel on a
                  FAILED staging would clear the error with no chat to show for it. */}
